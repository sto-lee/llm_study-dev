With fire our ancestors could move to new climates\nand eat new foods. Pottery, metallurgy,\nchemistry, rapid transportation and many other technologies\nall start with fire. But imagine if fire had been proprietary. What if that knowledge hadn't been shared? What if there had been\njust a few keepers of the fire? What would we be? My name is Dario Gil and I'm senior vice president\nat IBM and a director of IBM Research. We are in a landmark moment\nnow with generative AI that will shape our society\nfor generations to come. In this episode, I'm going to show you\nwhy you need to be your own AI firestarter,\nhow to take control of your AI destiny, to go from being just an AI user\nto become an AI value creator. Chances are you're already an AI user,\neven if you don't have a formal AI initiative or an AI team in place,\nit's already in use across your business. It might be baked into your off the shelf\napplications. It may show up in chat bots, in H.R. self-service portals, and transcription\nservices. These are what we might call\ntraditional AI. The focus is on executing discrete tasks,\nand usually each instance is trained individually on its own data\nthat you have to compile and label. Now, what makes Generative AI different\nis that it is enormously flexible and not limited to narrow tasks. Think of it as instead of filling\nspecific blanks, it can write the whole document\nfrom scratch to the point of being able to create or generate\nsomething entirely new. What makes this possible, are foundation models. Foundation models aren’t trained\nthe same way as traditional AI. They're trained\nusing self-supervised learning. You don't have to manually annotate\na massive amount of data. You tell them to go read\nenormous amounts of text, and they do. And you end up with a large\nbut versatile model with more humanlike language capabilities. Algorithms use mathematical models\nto represent the relationships\nbetween the words they ingest. If you give the model\na few words in a prompt, you can mathematically predict\nthe likelihood of words in the response. Instead of needing to build one A.I. model for each specific task,\nyou can train one model and adapt it to many varied\ndownstream tasks. So we went from one\ntask, one model to one model, many tasks. Your chat bot and your H.R. self-service can be built on the same model\nas the new app that will write your marketing emails\nand summarize legal documents. So that's the first critical point. Ideally,\na model is in the final form of AI. It's just a foundation you build on. How you use it is up to you. When it comes to using AI, there are basically three modes\nof consumption. The first is embedded AI, which I already mentioned,\nis baked in to off the shelf software. The software vendor creates the AI and you put it to use in your business. Whether it's a writing a system\nthat can help you strike the right tone in your email or image\nediting software that can automatically process\nyour images, you get access to some great functionality that can make you more productive,\nwhich we always want. But the caveat is that what you can buy so can everybody else. Those capabilities and productivity opportunities\ndon't become differentiators. They set a new higher baseline\nfor everyone. The second mode of consumption\nis through API calls. As you develop\ncustom applications for your business, they can call out to another company’s\nAI service using that company's models and processes\nand then return the results. This is also a valuable way\nof consuming AI, depending on how cleverly you use the APIs\nand the diversity of AI service providers you use. You can start to differentiate how you put\nAI to work relative to your competitors. But there are caveats here too. The first is that, like with software, the models and services\nyou tap into are available to everyone. The second is\nthat when that API call goes out, it's connecting to\nwhat looks like a black box. You don't necessarily know\nwhat's happening on the other end or the provenance\nand governance of the data use, which can make people nervous\nbecause your business is still accountable\nfor the final outcomes. And a second word of caution\nwhen using someone else's AI, has to do with the creation\nand accrual of value over the long term. In the past, we've seen a lot of value\nextractive business models. Another company would offer you a service\nlike this API call and you get value from that. But the other company\nis also extracting value from your usage and from your data\naccumulating more and more. How much faster is their value\ngrowing than yours? Well, you can see it in the stock\nprices over time. There is an imbalance in the relationship, that can have long term consequences\nboth for your specific business and for the overall economy\nand progress of technology. This goes back to the metaphor\nI used earlier. Philosophically, do we as a society\nreally want just a few keepers of the fire upon which we are all dependent? Is that what's best for your individual\nbusiness, for your shareholders? The third model of A.I. consumption is the platform model. This is the most comprehensive. This is how you become your own\nAI firestarter. And no, it doesn't mean doing it alone\nand reinventing the AI from scratch and spending years and millions of dollars\nto build your own models. With a platform\nyou have all the elements and ingredients in place to build your own AI solutions. You have foundation models. You have tools to improve\nand customize models, and you have processes\nto build your own tailored AI solutions. And importantly, you create and accrue value\nthat is unique to your business. Ultimately, I believe that most businesses should end up with a mix of all three. You'll use third party software\nwith AI embedded. Sometimes you'll be totally appropriate\nto use someone else's AI, but to fully realize the value of AI\nand to differentiate yourself from competitors, you’ll want a platform approach\nto create and own your AI. Let me just go a bit deeper on AI value creation,\nstarting with foundation models. Foundation models are large scale\ndeep neural networks trained with lots of unlabeled data and subsequently\nadapted to many downstream tasks. It may be a broad general model,\nor it may be a narrower, deeper model, but the key is that it is pre-trained\nwith the expectation that you can further enhance it\nwith your own proprietary data. Like when a new employee\njoins your business, they come in with some general skills\nas a foundation and the ability to learn. The more they learn about your business,\nthe more they add institutional knowledge and expertise,\nthe more value they deliver. Well, the same is basically true\nof our foundation model. You use your AI platform to tune it\nwith your specific business data, your proprietary knowledge and expertise, and it becomes more expert and\nmore valuable for your business over time. And because you're in\ncontrol of the platform and the processes and the data, you accrue ever larger\namount of value over time. With some of the consumer\nAI on the market, we've already seen some of what happens\nwhen you surrender that control. You can get bad data\nthat leads to bad outcomes. You can get hallucinations, basically an AI generating very confident\nand very incorrect answers. You can get into some trouble\nfor inadvertently using someone else's\nrights managed content. We've even seen proprietary\nor sensitive data being inadvertently\nleaked back into the public spaces. That's why\nyou need to know how your model is built and what data was included. And it's why tight control of\nyour sensitive data should be prioritized. Strong\nAI governance is absolutely critical. Yes, now it is the time to jump into AI, but please\nlook before you leap in and ensure that you're investing in a smart, safe,\nand sustainable approach where your business\nand your clients and customers are the primary beneficiaries. There is, I think, a myth about AI right now, a basic misunderstanding. For the general public generative\nAI has seemingly come out of nowhere. A lot of people think that there is a handful of consumer oriented\nAI experiences out there and that one model is going to win,\nor just a few leaders. I don't think that that's\nhow it's going to play out. The future of AI is not about one model, it's multi-model. Your business will be using multiple\nfine tuned models to achieve the best results\nwhen applied to specific use cases. That's why that platform approach\nis so important. And realistically,\nthe future of AI is not only proprietary. It will also be powered by open science\nand open source. Proprietary models will play a part. But so much of what is going to happen in\nthe future will not happen behind closed doors. It will play out in plain view with full transparency\nand accountability that open source provides. The energy in the open source\ncommunity is phenomenal. They are distributed projects, university\nprojects, corporate efforts, all driving innovation, producing foundation models\nthat you can tune and deploy for your use cases. Hugging Face is \nlike GitHub for foundation models. And there are over 325,000 open source models available\nand thousands more being added. And this is exactly how it should be\nfor the good of society in the long term. We don't want just one or a few winners,\na few companies that can define what AI is and dictate\nhow it's used. But that's not going to happen. What we're going to see\nis the democratization of AI. Okay, so I've talked about a lot of different\ntopics, and I basically told you that you have a lot of work\nto do to be great at AI, and maybe that feels overwhelming,\nbut really that's not my intention. My goal is to take down barriers\nto participation. Not put them up. There is a sense of urgency\nand fear about waiting too long and missing the moment. That's okay. I assure you that everybody is in the same\nsituation, feeling the same emotions. But I promise that\nif instead of rushing into fast and easy options to check the box and say,\nyes, I put AI in the business, if instead you are thoughtful\nand deliberate and strategic about an AI platform and data management,\nand AI governance, if you become an AI value creator. You're going to be in a position\nto succeed over the long term and you won't have to start over\nevery time the wind changes direction. You may not have all the products\nand processes you need today. You may not have all the skills in place. That's fine. If you're not ready to start alone, find a partner that you can trust\nand get to work so that you can take advantage\nof the extraordinary opportunities that generative\nAI will unlock for your business. Personally, I'm very excited about this chapter\nin technology. We, all of us together\nare going to use the AI to reshape not just our digital world,\nbut our physical world. We are going to use it to help tackle\nsome of our toughest social, medical, environmental problems,\nand more. We'll do it through science,\nbut also by empowering businesses like yours and mine\nto do more, faster and more responsibly. Whatever things you do,\nyou're going to get a power full new tool to help\nyou do them better. And its the AI value creators, that will be\nthe ones who make the biggest impact. It is the value creators who will take\nthe amazing foundational technology that is generative AI and use it to build\nentirely new solutions. That's why it is our goal\nto make AI accessible to everyone. To put it in your hands and I can't wait to see what you will do with it. Thank you\nfor watching this episode of AI Academy. I hope you will join us again as our IBM\nexperts take you on deeper dives into everything that a business leader\nneeds to know about AI."
