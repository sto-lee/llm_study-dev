Say you want to go net-zero with solar panels and other new sustainable technologies, not just to save money,  ...but also to make your home more resilient to external events, like thousand-year storms and heatwaves.  This challenge isn’t only relevant for domestic life.  Business leaders budgeting for major transformational technology initiatives face it as well, especially when it comes to Generative AI. Welcome to AI Academy.  I’m Anthony Marshall, Senior Research Director of Thought Leadership at the IBM Institute for Business Value.  In my role, I translate data and trends into narratives that help business leaders make sense of what’s happening around them. We recently conducted surveys of today’s top business leaders, executives, and CEOs, gaining new insights about, ...how they are budgeting for Generative AI and how they’re benchmarking their performance against peers.  This episode is designed to help you sharpen your understanding of how to budget for Generative AI. Business leaders know they need to invest wisely in Generative AI,  ...but what are they really investing in and how are they going to pay for it?  Let’s take our home improvement example and apply it to your business.  Budgeting for Gen AI isn’t so different from household budgeting or even traditional business budgeting, until it is.  But that’s what we often find when we talk to clients. They’re saying, we’ve run Gen AI through all our predictive and forecasting budgets, ...and applied assumptions we’ve been using for years, but it’s not working for Gen AI.  And that’s the tricky part.  Budgeting for Gen AI is different for budgeting for regular capital expenditure.  It’s thrown a wrench in traditional budgeting processes. If you treat Gen AI like traditional technology investment, it may never get funded.  It’s equivalent to ceding infrastructure in a factory investment.  If you treat Gen AI like business model innovation investment, it can be perceived as being way too risky or too remote,  ...or something that takes 10 years to produce a yield,  ...while at the same time,  ...we know that investing in Gen AI is essential for business to move forward and keep up with competitors and peers. Our CEO surveying is telling us that product and service innovation, ...has jumped up to be the single most important thing on CEO’s minds today.  They know they need to drive efficiency, but they’re also thinking,  ...how do I go from an efficiency story to a product and service innovation story, and how do I use Generative AI to get there? When it comes to the costs of Generative AI, a lot of attention has been directed to the cost of scaling AI models and cost of compute. Our most recent data shows that business leaders are finding infrastructure, cloud, and data to be the three, ...biggest cost buckets associated with Gen AI, with those three things alone accounting for over 40% of Gen AI costs.  Business leaders we’ve surveyed expect cloud costs to be double that of model costs.  So big costs are coming from processing data through AI models, not necessarily from creating models themselves.  But no matter what the actual spend ends up being,  ...where does the money come from to pay for things like infrastructure, data, and cloud?  You can be forgiven for thinking that evidence today isn’t entirely clear.  Our surveying shows perspectives and actions are a bit contradictory,  ...with very clear evidence of one thing, that investment in Gen AI is increasing.  But when we ask leaders where the money for Gen AI investment is coming from, only 18% say it’s from net-new spend. Most tech executives are taking big portions of their Gen AI budgets from other parts of their business, ...especially from elsewhere in the IT portfolio.  About a third of executives tell us that money for Gen AI is coming out of budgets not even related to AI spend.  There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to budgeting for Generative AI. But is there something that might work better?  Some business leaders are now saying that all Generative AI spend should be self-funding, that AI spend should be cost neutral. But in practice, is a cost-neutral budget for Generative AI possible?  And if it is, what resources and knowledge are needed to make it happen?  Is there technology with high-potential cost savings, ...that could be reinvested in Gen AI without sacrificing AI project or overall business performance. Let’s go back to our net-zero household.  Could we reduce some of their expenses?  Home entertainment or meals or travel, to buy some solar-ready heat pumps.  We asked business leaders how viable this idea is for Generative AI spend today. While Generative AI is partially self-funding today,  ...not a single executive we surveyed said Generative AI will be at 100% self-funding before 2026.  Yet, almost three quarters said Generative AI should be self-funding to justify its investment. Something has got to give, and it likely will.  Right now, an average Gen AI investment takes almost 14 months to deliver positive ROI,  ...compared to 10 months for other technology investments.  But that’s set to change.  As more people embrace smaller, more targeted AI models, combined with more agile approaches,  ...it’s likely that AI investments will start beating other IT investments in terms of ROI soon. Even when you self-finance Generative AI projects, there’s still the matter of proving that the investment was a good one.  It can be challenging to measure ROI of investments,  ...especially when you’re doing new things in new ways that haven’t even been conceived before,  ...as is often the case, when it comes to Generative AI. We are at an inflection point where some organizations are starting to see rapid ROI and others aren’t, at least for now.  It raises an interesting question.  Should Gen AI investment prioritize projects where strategic benefits are difficult to quantify?  Or should they focus on more narrow tasks or workflows that are less transformational and ambitious,  ...but more likely to have immediate financial benefits?  Because business leaders recognize that while Gen AI remains relatively new,  ...it’s an absolutely essential technology for long-term success.  And business leaders are optimistic that obstacles of measurement in ROI will resolve over time.  As Gen AI projects scale up beyond pilots, they will yield benefits that are easier to measure.  And new metrics will likely emerge that are easier to gauge.  We do a lot of surveying about Generative AI and three big budgeting mistakes consistently emerge.  First, not addressing bias concerns, and this may seem strange when it comes to AI budgeting.  Bias, like security, is a very big challenge for Generative AI.  Lots of people underestimate it.  But by not addressing bias in projects from the beginning, you’re risking major cost blowouts later on.  So think about it early and add contingency. Second, underestimating total cost of ownership.  Creating a Gen AI application is one thing,  ...but what about other more indirect costs – cost of deploying or retraining, or changing your organization.  We already know that one of the most important aspects of Generative AI is its interaction with people.  But have you planned for new ways of working, and have you factored in its costs? Third is about underestimating integration costs.  Gen AI doesn’t sit alone.  It often requires data from systems within and without your organization and your ecosystem.  How is it integrated with your systems and processes into all those things that make AI useful?  It needs to be understood right from the start. Business leaders are already taking leaps of faith with Generative AI, and they’re beginning to track its benefits.  Many are reinvesting saving or revenue from today’s Generative AI successes into tomorrow’s Generative AI moonshots.  Our data says 3 in 4 business leaders are thinking of Generative AI more like an innovation investment than traditional IT.  So if I had one single piece of advice, it would be to take a self-funded leap.  Take a wide-angle view, ...to understand how Generative AI projects tap human and technical resources to more accurately budget for unexpected costs.  To bring it all together, you can either invest in Generative AI, ...to solve existing problems or you can invest in it to unlock new capabilities.  Our surveying shows that about half of Generative AI investment goes toward enabling new capabilities.  But executives would like to see that closer to 60%.  Rethinking what Generative AI investment means to your business today and what it represents to your business tomorrow,  ...shapes how you go about funding and capturing value.  And thinking back to our net-zero household example, what would those net-zero tech investments represent to your life tomorrow? More comfort, more peace of mind because you have more options, ...or new capabilities to better control your environment, ...the next time a category 4 storm heads your way or the next time the electricity grid goes down for days. When it comes to investing in Generative AI for business, what does your business of the future really look like?  Conceptualize your answer to that and start from there. [Music]"
