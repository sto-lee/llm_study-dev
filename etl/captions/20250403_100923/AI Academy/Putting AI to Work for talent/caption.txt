the strongest organizations don't just fill a seat they find the talent that fits their needs and invests in them so everyone can play to their strengths and come together to keep the organization running smoothly my name is Kim moric and I am the global leader for AI first HR at IBM Consulting today I use my 25 years of experience in data and analytics to help clients keep their organizational pieces intact right from the moment generative AI Bur bur into the mainstream it was evident that it is unlike any technology that has come before and you can see how swiftly it is forcing leaders to rethink their assumptions plans and strategies in real time unlike new technologies that are all about what machines can do generative AI amplifies human capabilities it allows repetitive tasks to be automated which means HR Specialists can step back from day-to-day processing to focus on finding and grow growing their talent leading chro are jumping in to seize the moment and are developing their strategic AI road maps in business cases recruiters have to sift through hundreds of resum√©s for a single job posting this can start to get challenging and timeconsuming scheduling job interviews for multiple candidates and several interviewers takes coordination across several calendars and can delay the recruitment process leading to large lag times and a poor C candidate experience or even worse you might end up losing candidates to your competitors because they've got a more efficient hiring process with generative AI HR processes can change dramatically the technology lets you create an entirely new way of working resulting in exceptional employee experiences HR practitioners working in Talent acquisition for instance will be able to create compelling and accurate job descriptions faster with generative AI scheduling interviews well they'll be much less manual too as AI tools can check the availability of all the parties and suggest appropriate time slots the interview process well that is already seeing radical changes with Bots conducting the entire interviews for some seasonal jobs or conducting the initial screening interview for professional applicants drafting those offer letters in employee agreements those will become much faster and more accurate as these repetitive and timec consuming tasks get automated HR can shrink the hiring timeline dramatically and provide a frictionless onboarding experience for the candidate cutting down the time to hire also increases the organization's chance of Landing the most qualified candidate today's AI uses large language models to analyze vast amounts of user data to understand preferences and create tailored content allowing individuals to focus on information most relevant to them and this is particularly helpful when we look to engage the workforce HR professionals need to look at employee data holistically but this data can be hard to consolidate as employee data is often stored across several different fit for-purpose HR applications and guess what they don't talk to each other and a Consolidated solution that integrates the different platforms might not even be available for HR professionals as a result the scaling plan fails to address gaps or Worse distorts the true skill landscape of an organization with generative AI you can now get over the that hump of missing employee data by first using AI powered survey tools to ask employees about their own skills AI can then be used to analyze all available resources extract the key Concepts and quickly generate personalized learning content imagine creating content tailored to your talents career aspirations giving them a customized learning pathway that evolves according to their progress and their goals as Employee Engagement increases with this curated career development retention which sits alongside engagement also Trends upward as for managers who spend a lot of time going through different platforms to analyze employee progress imagine having an AI power compensation advisor that Maps bonuses to individual employee performance their contribution and their skills all while utilizing Market payscale data to ensure compensation you're offering is competitive the compensation adviser can also coach managers as they engage in performance and career conversations with their team now it goes without saying that AI will Usher in an efficiency shift like never before HR budgets are usually scrutinized very highly for return on investment and so it becomes doubly important that you don't buy peac meal solutions to solve your workflows because you'll end up siloing your data and creating even more disjointed user exper experiences but even before you focus on Solutions you need to consider if you have the structure and the strategy in place to start using AI will deploying AI tools add value to what you're doing now the next big step is to take along the people who are going to feel this change the employees once you have the right technology and made the cultural shift start aiming for the quick Roi use cases the repetitive tasks that are draining vast amounts of time from your HR professionals as well as your employees resolving these pain points with an AI automated solution will allow your employees to focus on higher value tasks as well as their own career progression while it's tempting to get carried away with all the gains that AI offers it is equally important to have your guard rails in place because AI does need to be governed AI can hold within its folds biased algorithms and logic there is a real risk that it can scale the bias that is already in your organization for example there are use cases where organizations implemented ungoverned AI recruiting algorithms and they had to pull the plug when their AI selection model started recommending only males for certain roles and females for other roles this is because the data that they trained the algorithm for had males going into all of the it roles and then females going into some of the other roles and so you have to start with the data to make sure the data is unbiased I think it would be best to think of generative AI as an assistant not a seasoned expert the assistant will need to have supervision from a human to provide oversight handle exceptions and ensure accuracy to ensure the responsible use of ai ai systems are now being designed to tell you how they reached a certain conclusion no more blackbox AI there is transparency and Trust in the decision making there are also robust Frameworks in place to prevent data leaks and mitigate biased decision-making having a layer of human governance at the top will absolutely be crucial to the success of AI HR was not meant to be a pure operational function it was meant to design and Elevate the employee experience with generative AI we might be moments away from Landing there imagine being able to design a seamless hiring process that begins with writing the job description and extends through the life cycle of talent in the organization as we continue to unpack AI its impact will spread wider and get better organizations also will pivot and adapt and this will push HR to the center stage as they become crucial in fitting in the pieces that will shape this future Workforce and I for one I'm definitely looking forward to it
