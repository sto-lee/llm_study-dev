Today's customer hates\nto wait for service. When I call up a brand\nor a service provider, I expect to get my\nquestions answered quickly and to my satisfaction. In the world of customer service, the challenge is to stay a step ahead of customer expectations and ensure that every brand interaction is not just positive, but\ndelightful for the customer. My name is Manish Goyal and I'm a Senior Partner\nin IBM Consulting, leading our AI analytics\nbusiness globally. The goal of my team is to help our clients apply AI analytics and\nautomation to create insights that drive better decisions. And one of the areas I\nspend a lot of time in is advising clients on how\nAI analytics can help deliver delightful customer experiences. This could be through\nself-service experiences or through aiding human agents with tools and insights\nso that they can deliver a great experience to the customer. Now, enterprises spend billions of dollars on customer service every year. Good customer service can turn one-time clients into\nlong-term brand champions. And the lifetime value of an NPS promoter can be 10 times more\nthan an NPS detractor. On the other hand, around\n80% of consumers say they would rather do\nbusiness with a competitor after more than one bad\nexperience with a brand. The contact center, the hub of most customer\nservice operations, has come a long way in the\npast couple of decades. Tools such as interactive\nvoice response (IVR), agent assist, robotic process\nautomation and chat bots have already made customer\nservice agents more productive. However, at most enterprises,\nthe use of these technologies is fragmented instead of seamless. At the same time, customer expectations continue\nto be more and more demanding these days, especially\ncoming out of the pandemic. Customers expect seamless\naccess and speedy resolution to their queries across\ndigital and voice channels. This in turn puts pressure on businesses to deliver a frictionless\ncustomer experience at every stage, from\ndiscovery to purchase, through service and retention. Now with generative AI, this experience can be\ntaken to the next level. Large language models have the\npower to significantly expand what can be automated, performing critical customer service tasks that are far beyond the capacities\nof earlier technologies. These models are trained\non vast amounts of data and can recognize, classify, and create sophisticated text and speech\nwith speed and precision. To see how generative AI can significantly\nimprove customer service, let's look at three key areas. The first is self-service, wherein you give the tools to\ncustomers to serve themselves. Virtual agents or chatbots\nserve the purpose here. And over the years, they\nhave become very good at being able to direct customers down a predetermined journey. To make these journeys, you first analyze what\npeople are asking about, you understand their intent and then handcraft the dialogue flows to direct them down the right journeys. In the past, creating\nthese flows took time, but now with generative AI, you can deliver much richer\nself-service experiences. These experiences are more\nnatural and conversational. They're more resilient to\nvariations and digressions, and the tooling to create these flows is also now being augmented\nwith generative AI, so that the process area\nand domain area experts can describe the journeys\nin natural language and AI generates the\nnecessary underlying flows. The second area, where generative AI can\nsignificantly improve customer experience is by\naugmenting the human agent, whether in the contact\ncenter or in the field. A lot of time is spent by\nagents in the contact center searching knowledge bases to resolve the queries for customers. Generative AI can dramatically\nimprove the retrieval of this information\nfrom the knowledge bases and present it back to\nagents in a summarized way, to help resolve the\ncustomer query quickly. This cuts down the time that\nthe customer is on hold, improving their experience, while also allowing the\nagent to handle more calls during their shift. Similarly, field service\nagents can be armed with generative AI based solutions that help them troubleshoot\nproblems in the field faster and more accurately. Another good example is helping agents draft email\nresponses automatically, based on the context or query, allowing them to review and edit before responding to the customer. AI augmented emails have shown to have a higher\nsatisfaction score by customers. And the third area is in\ncontact center operations. Let's say you have a\ncall center of a thousand or maybe ten thousand agents. Gaining insights into what's happening across all the conversations taking place between agents and customers was difficult or expensive before. With generative AI, you can\ngo through the transcripts of every call made and\ncontinuously gather insights on how and why agents\nare taking a long time to handle certain types of calls, or understanding granular\nclassification of complaints on products or services. This insight that a application\nof generative AI provides can allow your operations\nleaders to find the root cause of a problem faster and resolve them, if in the servicing function, or alert the product or marketing teams, if they need to take remedial action. There's also a lot of time spent by agents, after each call with a customer, documenting a summary\nof their conversations and actions taken. During that after call work time, they're unavailable to attend a new call. Again, with generative AI, you can transcribe in real time the conversation that they're having and generate a draft of the summary that agents can then edit and\nfeed back into the CRM system. Not only does this drive consistency in capturing details of each\nconversation with customers, but it also saves time\nand drives productivity for the agents. Today, as the cost of building\nthese solution comes down with foundation models and\nthe ROI becomes justifiable, there's a renewed focus on the ways generative AI can\nbe used for customer service. And it's not difficult to imagine why! Customer service has always been complex. Just think of the last time you called in for customer service. Chances are you wanted to\naddress a problem you were facing with a purchase or a product\nor a service you have; and if you have a problem,\nyou are generally unhappy, which is why enabling service\njourneys that anticipate and deliver delightful\nomnichannel experiences, whether as a self-service function or a human assisted one is critical. Secondly, in some companies,\nthere are a lot of employees who can influence the\nexperience customers have with the brand or service. If you can augment their skills and drive productivity\nacross this large population who front your brand, it'll be a huge win for your enterprise. And given the capabilities of AI and the rate at which it is evolving, you can expect significant\ngains in productivity with the right deployment. And there's more! As businesses focus on building\nomnichannel experiences for their customers, AI can power interactions\nor conversations irrespective of the channel\ncustomers come in from. Which means a customer request that originated in one channel can be completed in another\nchannel, seamlessly. Combining traditional\nAI with generative AI enterprises can drive proactive outreach, helping avoid problems or\nhelp resolve them faster. If you were to look closely\nat how these companies achieve high levels of coordination\namongst their channels, you will discover a five step\napproach driving the execution. The first step, as you kick\noff, is to have a clear idea of the experience you want to deliver. Next is to understand your customers well. What is the demographic,\npreferences, digital or voice? And now that you know your\naudience, you need to determine how you want to serve them, decide what channels you\nwant to direct them to. And then, look at the best tools that can support those channels. So what is your platform? Do you go with the cloud-based\ncontact center solution? Will it be on-premises for\nother reasons, or something else? Once you have your tool chain sorted, the final step is to design\nthe journey end-to-end, so it delivers on the service strategy, the experience you had\ndefined when you started. My favorite story, and\nit really warms my heart whenever I speak of this, is the work that we have been doing with the US Veterans Affairs since 2019. Before we came in, it used\nto take a really long time for veterans to get their benefits. We applied analytics and automation to help support faster claim creation and response to veterans. Just a few numbers: 3 million\npackets processed end-to-end, and these packets have\nlots of documents in them. 280 different document types, 24 distinct mail type processes, 100% automation of all mail intake. We are processing 220,000\ndocuments per week. We then took that process further, by applying sophisticated AI\nto analyze the medical records. We are now helping the claims adjudicator make decisions faster, so that the veterans who\nfought for our country get the help they need\nwithout the long wait. And since 2023, we have\nprocessed over 125,000 claims. We have been expecting AI\nto make a big difference for quite some time now. And I think the capabilities have finally caught up with the hype. What's more, the innovation\nrate has also accelerated dramatically, with a new\nannouncement almost every week. It is becoming increasingly evident now that the faster you add the capabilities of generative AI to your organization, the sooner you can make use\nof the unlimited opportunities it opens up. Imagine the next time your\ncustomer runs into a problem and needs help: You'll\nhave all the capabilities to turn a possibly adverse situation into a positive experience,\nwithout making them wait, and perhaps, even before\nthey pick up the phone. So the question for enterprises looking to fold AI into\ntheir customer service is no longer, \"Why?\" But \"When?\""
