if you're like most Security Professionals you're constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of emerging threats and improve your organization security posture this is where AI has the potential to make a big difference think what it would mean if it took 108 fewer days on average to identify and contain a data breach this faster containment was a key finding for those that extensively used Ai and automation versus those that didn't according to IBM's cost of a data breach report 2023 that was based on a survey of over 500 organizations today we're going to explore how user Behavior analytics or uba with AI and machine learning can help you detect and respond to Insider threats quickly and precisely but before we show you how it works let's step into the shoes of those on a security team as you know Insider threats are a major concern for organizations of all sizes according to the cost of a data breach report the average cost of an Insider threat for an organization was $4.9 Million us the costliest of all reported initial attack vectors so it's absolutely critical that you have a solution that will help you identify and contain these threats faster that's where uba comes in uba uses machine learning which is a subset of AI that focuses on analyzing user Behavior to identify anomalies and potential threats when integrated with a Sim solution uba can assist Security Professionals and help them detect and respond to Insider threats more effectively now let's take a look at how uba Works in action as part of a leading Sim solution here we're using curate our SIM from IBM security with its built-in uba app to demonstrate how we can help you quickly and easily identify and contain Insider threats in this scenario I'll be playing the role of a security analyst tasked with locating Insider threats or compromised employees I'll use the uba app to quickly review the numerous alerts I see every day on employee Behavior to help effectively identify those employees who pose a real threat uba uses a combination of use cases or rules and machine learning to determine the normal daily behavior of a user on a network and their Associated peer group it takes a minimum of 7 days for uba to learn user patterns and detect suspicious anomalies okay so let's get started here the user Behavior analytics dashboard provides several ways for the analyst to understand current risks on the left is a list of employees prioritized by risk analysts can also create watch lists to monitor select groups such as highly privileged employees in the middle the uba app provides a view of the alerts or offenses as they're called in Q radar finally on the right you can see the risks over time and the risk category breakdown by resource now let's look at a risky employee in this view the analyst can see the relevant information about an employes behavior for example here's how many identities the person has on the lower left are all the offenses related to this person the upper right panel shows the timeline of user events finally the lower right shows the events grouped by session and Associated indicators of compromise or ioc's for each one now let's go back to the dashboard and check out the recent offenses that were generated based on the information obtained from the uba app at the top of this offenses page we can see highlevel information related to this potential security threat this information includes key attributes such as the correlated events that triggered the anomalous activity alert along with the source and destination IP addresses below this information we can see the miter attack mappings these map mapping show the tactics and techniques identified by Q radar during its automated investigation we can see more results at the bottom where we can quickly identify key information that's relevant to this particular Insider Threat by integrating AI to gain valuable insights from structured and unstructured data into security operations Q radar help security analysts significantly accelerate their investigations to take only minutes instead of hours or days this means sock te can shift their focus to more proactive defense efforts instead of struggling to react to alerts all day so for this particular alert we can look at the key observables identified by Q radar during its investigation we can see how many are critical as well as the number of threat actors malware families high value assets and high value users that exist within the current environment we can compare the investigation results to other investigations from a month ago we can even see if these ioc's are found locally or if they're just exist within the overall environment and we can view the trend for these ioc's over time we can quickly see an overview of the different miter attack tactics and techniques that we've identified in this particular investigation we can see the confidence level associated with this tactic and technique which was generated by Q radar Security Professionals can help Q radar improve its analysis and future responses by providing human feedback that specifies whether they agree disagree ree or uncertain about the findings of Q radar Q radar also has natural language insights that allow security analysts to quickly view what ioc's or other observed events are identified in its investigation in addition we can look at related investigations that curator identified along with the offense summary if we want to look at the visualized relationships within this alert we can click on the offense relationship graph button in this view we can quickly visualize the key ioc for this alert on the left side we can toggle which relationships we want to see including relationships found from the analysis of internal event and flow data as well as the relationships that curar uncovered using AI to conduct external research again we can give some feedback to provide human reinforcement learning to Q radar once we've completed our investigation we can head back into the offenses summary to quickly start looking at other Insider threats ioc's or or ingested correlated information that has been conducted by Q radar in conclusion Q radar Sim represents a significant step forward in harnessing Ai and automation for security operations by streamlining processes enhancing skills and providing actionable insights Q radar helps security analysts stay ahead of emerging threats by worrying less about tedious manual tasks and allowing them to focus on fortifying their organization's
