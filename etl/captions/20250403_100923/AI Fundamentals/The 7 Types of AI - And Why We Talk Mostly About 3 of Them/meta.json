But these seven types of AI \ncan largely be understood by examining two   encompassing categories. There's AI capabilities, \nand there's AI functionalities. So let's start   with AI capabilities, and there are three. The \nfirst of which is known as artificial narrow AI,   which also goes by the rather unflattering name of \n\"weak AI\". Now, on its face, that doesn't sound like   a very interesting capability to start us off. \nBut actually, narrow AI is the only type of AI   that exists today--it's all we currently have. Any \nother form of AI is theoretical. So we can think   of this as realized AI--that's the artificial \nintelligence we have today. And theoretical AI,   which is the artificial intelligence we may have \nin the future. And now narrow AI can be trained   to perform a narrow task, which, to be fair \nto narrow AI, might be something that a human   could not do as well as the AI can. But it can't \nperform outside of its defined task. It does need   us humans still to train it. So if narrow AI \nrepresents all AI capabilities we have today,   well, what else is there? Well, a favorite of \nmemes, science fiction, and betting markets is   artificial general intelligence, also known as \nAGI. And also known as \"strong AI\". To be clear,   AGI is currently nothing more than a theoretical \nconcept. But here's the idea: AGI can use previous   learnings and skills to accomplish new tasks \nin a different context, without the need for   us human beings to train the underlying models. \nIf AGI wants to learn how to perform a new task,   it will figure it out by itself. Which \nsounds... disconcerting. But, but look,   we haven't even talked about the third type of AI \ncapability yet. And that's artificial \"super AI\". If   ever realized, super AI would think, reason, \nlearn, make judgments and possess cognitive   abilities that surpass those of human beings. \nThe application's [possessing] super AI capabilities   would have evolved beyond the point of catering \nto humans sentiments and experiences, and would be   able to feel emotions and have needs and possess \nbeliefs and desires of their own. Yeah. So let's   park that cheery thought for now, and consider \nthe four types of AI based on functionalities.   And we're back in the real world of realized \nAI here--at least initially. So we can think   of narrow AI as having two fundamental functions. \nOne of those is reactive machine AI. Now reactive   machine AI are systems designed to perform a very \nspecific specialized task. Reactive AI stems from   statistical math, and it can analyze vast amounts \nof data to produce a seemingly intelligent output.   We've had reactive AI for quite a long time. Back \nin the late 1990s, IBM's chess playing supercomputer   Deep Blue beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov by \nanalyzing the pieces on the board and predicting   the probable outcomes of each move. That's a \nspecialized task with a lot of available data   to create insights. The hallmark of reactive AI. \nWe can think of other narrow AI functionalities   really as being classified as \"limited memory \nAI\". Now this form of AI can recall past events   and outcomes and monitor specific objects or \nsituations over time. It can use past and present   moment data to decide on a course of action most \nlikely to help achieve a desired outcome. And as   it's trained on more data over time, limited \nmemory AI can improve in performance. Think of   your favorite generative AI chatbot, which relies \non limited memory AI capabilities to predict the   next word or the next phrase or the next visual \nelement within the context it's generating. Okay,   so what about our two theoretical AI capabilities? \nWell, if we look at AGI, we have to think about   \"theory of mind AI\". Now, this would understand \nthe thoughts and emotions of other entities,   specifically us, so it could infer human motives \nand reasoning and personalize its interactions   with individuals based on their unique emotional \nneeds and intentions. And actually, emotion AI   is a theory of mind AI currently in development. \nAI researchers hope it will have the ability to   analyze voices, images and other kinds of data \nto understand and respond to human feelings.   Finally! An AI that really understands me. And \nthen finally, under super AI, we have \"self-aware   AI\". Winning my personal award for the scariest AI \nof all, it would have the ability to understand   its own internal conditions and traits, leading to \nits own set of emotions, needs and beliefs. Look,   we've covered seven types of AI, and only three \nof them actually exist today! There is still so   much to be learned and discovered. But as \nthose advancements happen, at least here we   have a taxonomy of AI types that will tell \nus how far along we are on our AI journey."
