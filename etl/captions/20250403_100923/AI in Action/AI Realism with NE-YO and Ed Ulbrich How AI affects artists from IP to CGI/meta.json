I just need someone to show me\nthe positive aspects of this AI thing. Generative AI offers great power,\nand the great unknown. While being transported into new realms\nof creativity is awe-inspiring, generative\nAI is also seen as an ethical minefield. Today, we're talking about\nthe amazing, uncanny, and sometimes eerie world of unreal reality in music, film,\nand your daily scroll. We're now extremely lucky to be joined by three time\nGrammy Award winning hitmaker Ne-Yo. Ne-Yo. Welcome. How you doing, brother? Hey. Well, look,\none of the things that a lot of people might not know about you is that you've got a real passion\nfor science and technology. So please, let's jump into that. I want to know where that comes from. Well, it all starts with video games. I've been a video game head for a really,\nreally long time still am to this day is actually my my, my therapy. You know, when I need, when I need a break\nfrom the music industry. Normally, you can find me somewhere\nwith my PlayStation just doing that. But, it started there,\nand then it started getting into the art of creating video games. And, you know, what it takes to\nto make the video games look the way they look\nand things of that nature. So it started there and then and then,\nyou know, blossomed into more interest in the behind the scenes work of just what it is to create\nsome of my favorite video games. And then it goes deeper than that\ninto coding and all of those things. Actually, I invested in a coding school\nnot too long ago, just just out of sheer passion\nfor the knowledge of it. Yeah. So, so, yeah,\nthat's that's where it starts. Well, it sounds like if you're interested\nin something, you go all in and you seem to take your passions\nand really turn that into something even greater than yourself. So let's pivot that to talking about\nAI some. Let's start off\nwith the positive about that. What are you excited about\nin the space of AI? I personally feel the AI situation\nis about what it's going to be used for. You know, it's I understand it's the future\nand it's not going anywhere anytime soon. And I'm not anti AI. I just need someone to show me\nthe positive aspects of this AI thing. You know, it kind of what sparked this\nwhole thing is when somebody showed me an AI program that could not only attempt\nto write a song in the style of Ne-Yo, but then showed me another one\nthey attempted to sing the song using my voice, and that just, that just,\nthat didn't fly with me. I'm like, wait a minute. No one sees this as a threat at all? This doesn’t strike anybody is weird\nthat there's a whole song here written in my style, singing my voice,\nand I had nothing to do with it? That's not weird to anybody else? So, I mean, that's that's, you know,\nthat's kind of where I sit with it. Again, I'm waiting on someone to bring me\nthe positive aspects of this whole AI thing in regards to music creation and,\nand the music industry, because as of right now,\nall I can kind of see is the red flags. Now, again, I'm 100% open to someone showing me the positive aspects of\nI just have yet to see them. Quick question then, when you did hear some of the songs\nthat were created using this AI in this form of Ne-Yo,\nin the styling of Ne-Yo, what’d you think? Did it sound good? It didn't sound bad. No, it wasn't bad at all. The worst part about it is that again,\nit was my voice and a style similar to mine. You know, it was... a good impersonation, I’ll say. It was a it was a very good impersonation. But the reality is it wasn't me. Well, then let's stay in this space\nfor a moment, because what you're talking about\nare really some true ethical considerations\nthat a lot of us have about AI. So let's talk\nabout some of those concerns. You remember Napster and then iTunes,\nand then when Spotify came on in and changed the music industry forever. Is it possible\nthat gen AI is just the next reset? It's definitely possible. And, I think that it would be smart to get ahead of it as opposed to,\nyou know, how it happened with Napster. You know, where,\nit had to be the whole lawsuit thing. And then all of a sudden\nthat becomes the norm. Yeah,\nit would be smart to get in front of it. But, if AI is doing it all for you,\nwhat are you doing as the human being like? You know, nowadays, I got a question every song that comes\nacross the table, because it could be it could be an AI that did it\nand it's like, okay, am I working with this songwriter\nor am I working with this machine? Again, great impersonations all day long. Yeah, fantastic. And that's great for,\nyou know, the the fun element of it. It's fun to listen\nto SpongeBob SquarePants sing a TI song. Yeah. That's fun. Let’s like imagine\na world where artists can protect or control their likeness\nwhile becoming still more efficient. Do you think that there's a possibility\nyou can use AI to write your songs with you, and then you can go on vacation\nand then maybe, like, come back in and check it and give it some notes\nand then craft it together. To be completely honest, to me all that\nsounds like is artists getting lazy. It just it just sounds like it just sounds like\nan opportunity for an artist to get lazy. But Ne-Yo, when artists first experienced\nPro Tools for the first time, do you think that they had\na similar reaction? Because... I felt the same way.\nYou did feel the same way. I felt the same way about Pro Tools. Again, there are people that spent years\nlearning how to sing on key and now anybody can sing on key\nat the push of a button. Again, I'm not against technology. I'm not even against AI. AI is the next wave. It's not going anywhere, I get it,\nI understand that. I just need to know how I'm supposed\nto not feel threatened by a machine that’s going to come in and try to take away\nwhat it is that I that that I do. So let's take matrix\nout of the studio. Right. So I'm getting that, you know,\nyou're not a huge fan of having AI really assist you in the studio\njust yet. But let's think about performance\nbecause I know you are also very known for your live performances. You've had different versions of yourself\nthat you've tapped into for multiple albums.\nThere have been multiple eras of Ne-Yo. What if you wanted to do sort of like a Ne-Yo eras show where it's\nyou and then different versions of you, and we've got those other versions\nthat we're using AI in order to generate. It could be cool, I guess. For something like that. Hold on!\nDid Ne-Yo just crack a little bit on AI? No, I didn’t. Because it’s, because it's still me. I appreciate\njust you being genuine and open and honest about AI, you know,\nand where you are right now in AI. Because here's the thing, Ne-Yo, I feel like if we do a follow up\ninterview, like in a year or two, a whole new song might be being sung,\nyou may have, you may, you might. You might. I mean, you might be right,\nyou might be wrong. Well, I'm thankful that we've had\nthe authentic Ne-Yo on here today at 100%. It's been a real privilege\nto talk with you, man. But I also hear that you've got a new tour\ncoming on up. So tell me a little bit about what\nwe can look forward to with that. Yes, indeed. And it's really me, guys. It's\nno holograms. It's me out there singing, dancing,\nsweating, being a whole human, all right? Sharing emotions and passions\nwith other human beings. That's what it is. That's what my tour is. We're in Australia right now. It's the champagne and roses tour. We go from Australia to Singapore\nto to Japan to China. We go home for a minute for,\nyou know, for Christmas and the holidays. And then come to top of the year, Mary\njust announced it myself, Mary J. Blige. Mario, we're going out again.\nDomestic. We'll be in a city near you,\nand it'll be actually us. It'll be actually as. Well, to use one of your own words,\nit sounds as though the real Ne-Yo is irreplaceable. I like what you did there. I like what you did there. I dig that. I dig that. Alright, so Ne-Yo obviously has some legitimate concerns\nabout how AI gets employed moving forward. So let's talk to someone who's actively\nusing it with artists. Ed Ulbrich, Chief\nContent Officer at Metaphysic.ai. Ed, welcome. Hey, Albert, how are you? I'm really excited to talk to you today. Yeah. Me too.\nGlad to glad to be here with you. So let's start off by talking about your work\nas Chief Content Officer at Metaphysic.ai. I know that you recently made Eminem\na young Slim Shady again at the VMAs. So did you do that just to help\nmillennials like me not feel like we're turning 40? What I find fascinating is there's\nthere are artists that are really leaning in early into AI and,\nyou know, you couldn't predict, but but, you know, Marshall\nMathers, and his team have been, seekers. I would say they have been early.\nThey have been pioneering. They've been looking\nthey've been, investigating. What I love about\nthis is seeing artists, you know, and I'm I am blessed, we'll get to this, but it's such a cool thing right now\nto be able to sit with great artists. They see our technology\nthrough the lens of the creative problems they're trying to solve in ways\nwe would have never imagined. And so it's just magic to see something. They'll see it differently\nand find an application for it. What I love about this particular\nproject is it is using AI technology magic, really in support of story\nand narrative and something bigger, right? So it's not just a gimmick, it's it's\nsort of a through line and it's something he's using in the work.\nAnd I think it's just brilliant. And and I find what he's doing, it's\nvery personal. And he's using this technology in a way\nto express himself very personally, which, was refreshing\nand surprising like that. So to me, it's just like,\nwhat an honor, right? To see people just harness\nthis and just do amazing things. And it blew up, obviously. Yeah. I mean, as a viewer, as a fan,\nyou see it and you get chills. So it is eliciting\nthis very emotional reaction. Absolutely. I mean, like\nI couldn't have said it better. That is, the power of this is you\nstop looking at how it was made. It just is, right? And everything I've done for the 30 years\nprior, we're struggling to get past that, you know, and hide it. But, you know,\nthese are very different tools we use now. But Ed,\nI do want to know how it's made though. So how does this technology even work\nlike on a practical level, how do you build a generative AI program that can make someone come\nto life on stage? Yeah. Well, that's a\nthat's a big question that we could probably do a multi-part session\non, with some people far smarter than me. I would tell you, just in general,\nit's data science, right? This is a fundamental shift\nfrom everything I've ever known. And to be quite honest,\ntwo and a half years ago, two years ago, I was introduced to a TikTok of deepfake\nTom Cruise. Right. So that was sort of like, wow. And it was a friend. And I'm coming from your high end\nvisual effects, you know, from from doing, you know, big, big, you know,\nMarvel movies and, and all that stuff. And so we saw that was like,\nwait, what's that, right? Now, at the same time, we'd also seen deepfakes that were kind of ehh,\nand it's all sketchy and stuff. But this just artistically being used in a way to entertain and make people\nlaugh and smile, but it was so well done. So who's doing that?\nWe were trying to figure it out. So that ends up turning into a visual\neffects supervisor friend of mine who does huge movies. A guy named Kevin Bailey, and he was working with Robert Zemeckis. He's Robert Zemeckis’s\nvisual effects supervisor for movie after movie after movie. He saw the potential taken from a TikTok all the way to how you could deploy this\non a major motion picture. It's Here, H-E-R-E, Robert Zemeckis. It's Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. It's a beautiful, amazing, film that, you know, otherwise\nlikely couldn't have been made. That's the one where it looks\nas though the entire movie is shot from the exact same angle\nthrough time? It is. Nothing moves, but time,\nand time is moving constantly around this. And and it settles into this, this family. And it's just beautiful. And, it is such an extraordinary thing\nbecause this is a technology wonder. I mean, a technological wonder,\nit is, an unbelievable undertaking. And and yet it worked so well. It was, really a game changer for me. And so when I saw that, that from that\nTikTok to to getting to actually, because I didn't work at Metaphysic\nat that time, right Metaphysic, it just started,\nthey'd done a screen test to, get this project when I saw it, it was\nit was extraordinary. I was both mind blown, like, oh, my God,\nthat is amazing. And at the same time, just like,\noh my God, like that. This is a profound quantum leap for me. It was like I could take everything I've ever known\nwith the best people in the world using those tools and deploy them\nagainst this, and we could never do that. And then I found out\nit's rendered and done in real time. As the actor’s performing, the AI I'm not,\nthat's being driven in real time live. And that was like, oh my God. And immediately I realized, like, over here I have horses\nand buggies and rocks and sticks, and here these people have thermonuclear\nfusion and they're focusing it, and they haven't\neven scratched the surface yet. And so that's so I have, I'm all in. Ed, you mentioned the term\ndeepfake though. And I know that that can be\na very controversial term. So where do you sit on that. And how do you consider the work\nthat you do as related to deepfake? I hate that term. I do, but I hate it\nfor, it's words, it’s letters. It's I think it comes from a bad place,\nright. That,\nthat that word that, that made up thing, I think, and therefore\nit has a bad connotation in the culture. That's not the tool. That's the the people. Right. Be real clear about that. That same tool or tools like it or, or methodologies\nutilizing data science in certain ways. There are people doing extraordinary\nthings like emotional, moving\nhumanity things using this technology. So it's language. I think it's a moment in this continuum\nof all things I can say in a few years from now that what is will be\nwe won't be talking about this anymore. There'll be all kinds of brand new stuff\nto be dealt with. Right? I mean, because as empowering\nas this technology is, we can both acknowledge\nthat it doesn't come without pitfalls. Absolutely. Because, you know,\nthere are artists who are worried that they'll be impersonated\nby or replaced by AI. So what are you doing in your work\nso that artists are building with AI? Yeah. Oh, that's a big question. It's a very important question. We're like in the wild, wild west, right? There's really no law and order yet. It hasn't all been figured\nout. And so, you know. Oh yes. You know, any technology in the wrong hands\ncan be used for terrible things. People see, like I told you, artists\nlook at what we do, and magic happens because they're seeing it through\nwhat they're trying to express and look and try to apply it.\nAnd and from that comes all this magic. But similarly, you know, other people\ncan see things in a different way. It comes down to access,\nwhich requires money. There's still a barrier to entry. Not to say that it's not that much money. And some pretty extraordinary\nthings can be done, I would say from our perspective, from my personal perspective also,\nand what I was drawn to to join this company\nto take on this movie. And now we've done three movies\nand we have all this amazing stuff is, one is we're here\nto we've devoted ourselves to we're helping\nsave the world from boredom. Right. That's our mission. Right? So so that's our our purpose. This is very much, an entertainment endeavor currently. We are a technology company\nthat makes tools that we are expressing, creatively in entertainment\nand doing so quite well. That is,\nthat is a whole, whole lot of fun. At the same time, we're sort of\nin uncharted territory when we now get to identity and likeness\nand those types of things. Now, I will also tell you,\nbecause this old guy with the white hair and has been doing this a very long time. So we have been scanning famous actors\nand celebrities for 25 years. Right. We have been creating CG\nlikenesses of them for, you know, that long as well,\nto varying degrees of success. So these are not new issues. And it's funny because weirdly,\nwhat was it, in 2009, I got to do a Ted talk\nafter The Curious Case of Benjamin Button talking about all these same issues,\nall these. I got the questions at the end\nfrom from Chris Anderson. So tell us\nwhat are the ethical implications? And it was like\nthis was what, 15 years ago. And that is what’s interesting is\nwe're having the same conversation now. But there's a point on it\nand there's just a big, strike. You know, as you recall, you know,\nthe entire industry was shut down. One of the foundational issues was AI. It was also the same for the writers. So it's a thing\nclearly, there's a lot of fear. We had to look at this in a way\nlike we have to behave ethically. That's all you have to do is self-regulate because there are no,\nwe're in this time... A guy I used to work with, at an ad agency\na long time ago named Rashad Tobacoala and he has this great quote. The future does not fit\nin the containers of the past. Oh, hold on, let's say that again. The future does not fit\nin the containers of the past. I just I heard that it was like bullseye. That for where I am right now,\nwhere we are right now, that just says it all\nbecause we're applying our usual thinking to this new thing\nand it doesn't fit. This is brand new stuff. So intellectual property\nlaw, identity, property sovereignty, all these things like who owns what,\nhow do I protect myself? Like, as it turns out,\nyou don't own a copyright of yourself, right? You don't own yourself. At least your images of yourself. It's a complicated time. So behaving\nethically is sort of at the core. And so I meet the founders of Metaphysic,\nand that's the first thing out of their mouth is ethics first. So, you know, that means you don't go\nscrape the internet, right? That that means that we have to be secure. We have to be confidential, you know,\nand there's there's a nice thing. In Hollywood, there are standards and\nrules already that are pretty significant. And for good reason. Half of filmmaking\nthat you see in theaters today, you know, one half of it\nhappens in like in a camera on a set. The other half is happening in computers\nall around the planet. So there are very strict\nsecurity protocols, how things are done, you know, so\nthat exists, there's layers beyond that. But we do believe, you know,\npeople should own and control their data. Let's dig even deeper into that thing\nwith ethics and regulations, because as you're saying,\nartists have a lot to gain with AI, but there is a need for that protection. You're building this content. So as someone who's doing that, how do you ensure the artists\nthat they're safe to take the leap? That’s a, it's consent, right. Yeah. No consent, no AI. Right, that's it. We we build models, we train with training data,\nwe do data acquisitions, and we we... And so all that needs to be\nif we're using existing materials, that has to be licensed\nand cleared, right. If you get no license,\nno clarity, no AI, that's just it. We just you just have to set a standard\nfor yourself because currently they're not laws\nthat are requiring us to do this. But there will be there should be,\nthey are coming, we hope. They need to be because of the other people\nthat are using similar technologies and having different ideas, and not here\nto help save the world from boredom and make you smile or think. But other agendas, right? So there needs to be laws. There need to be regulations. In the meantime, we behave accordingly. Look, I'm\njust thinking just off the top of my head, off of the projects that you mentioned,\nyou've had to convince or your company, your team has had to convince,\nlike Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, these A-list stars to feel comfortable\nenough to give themselves on over to AI. So just for fun,\ncan you give me an elevator pitch in terms of how do you convince somebody like that\nthat they are safe to dive in? There's a lot of education\nthat that needs to happen. I will also tell you, you know,\nyou mentioned Brad Pitt, but, you know, we just Brad Pitt back in 2008/9\nwhen we were making Benjamin Button. And by the way, that wasn't the first time\nhe'd been scanned and done this either. He's done this a lot. Right. So when we work with some of these,\nyou know, Tom Hanks is not, new to the scanner, right? I think the issue now is the it's\nthe technology. Right.\nQuite, quite honestly, it's it's not that we couldn't create\ncapture likenesses and have data of them. It was just, you know, if you wanted to do\nanything, it was damn expensive, right? Because it took a lot of people,\nyou know, in buildings around the world. But, you know, today,\nyou know, it's very different. There's incredibly powerful technology. It's accessible\nand it's it's going so fast. And I would say in many cases\nit's education is what's missing, right? It's moving so fast that there is no way\nto educate fast enough. And if people aren't leaning in and trying and paying attention\nand kind of jumping into it, it just it's just sailing past them. And so, that's what I see. I have a lot of people, you know,\nyou guys are, you know, eliminating jobs. You're it's a revolution. It's like, well, I don't I've never considered myself a\nrevolutionist, you know, I've heard this. I'm old. Right? 30 years ago, when we started\nDigital Domain in Venice, California, one of the co-founders, James\nCameron, Scott Ross, Stan Winston, these are, you know, major people\nin visual effects and entertainment. And obviously James Cameron, my hero, you know, and and this company, launches and we are like,\nwe are all digital. It was all CGI, right? Well, there was an outrage, right? People were like,\nyou're going to put people, you know, motion control\ncameramen and model makers and miniatures and pyrotechnics,\nscenic painters and matte painters. You're going to put us all out of work\nand it was like, well, that wasn't the intent,\nbut there's just new tools, right? You know, it’s kind of undeniable. And I remember coming into the studio\none day, you know, 28 years old,\nand there's picketers around us, and there wasn't\neven a labor union strike. It was just people like, you know, in the industry, it was like\nthat was really like, wow, this is crazy. Like it's we're just do it.\nAnd to me, it's just CGI, right. Well, cut to, you know, here we are. That industry,\nyou know, exploded massively after that, after the dawn of CGI in the late 90s,\nyou saw the jobs grow by the thousands. There are now tens and tens and,\nyou know, there are, we created tens of thousands of jobs\ncoming out of that. Yeah. As a result of that shift in, in the,\nin the use of technology proliferated and we start to see morphing\nshifting to digital to the point where half of the movie is\nmade in the computer now. I mean, that's\njust that's just where it's at. So still very, very, very,\nvery expensive, very, very, very slow. You know, people don't realize that there's\nlike a thousand people working on a movie. Let's talk about the potential\nthat I'm thinking about, you know, young filmmakers out there, young artists\nor even as big name artists. Can you talk to us about how I can be used as a creativity amplifier\nrather than a shortcut? Amen. That's it. It’s an amplifier. It is that I say\nit's like it's jet fuel for creativity. I would say, you\nknow, it's an exciting time. It really you look at like this\nit we've seen disruption, right? I saw the CGI disruption. And then within that we saw\nall these things happening as humans and, and game engines. And so, you know, it's exploded. And then I see this test for this movie\nand it was like, you know, stops you dead in your tracks\nfor this movie Here. Right. It's just like, oh,\neverything changes with that. That moment was just like, you know, you can't go back\nand then you start to go forward and you realize, like,\nI'm just now learning. So many people are doing\nso many exciting things. Right? And so I think it's it's like lean in. I tell a lot of people, like, you know what do you recommend to\nvisual effects artists today? It's like, look up, everyone's very busy\nlooking down. Just look up because few\npeople know what we're doing even. It's like there's so much stuff going on,\nlike get into it. The other thing is\nit's a transfer of skill, right? And what I'm seeing,\nand this is so wonderful, it's like people who make visual effects\nin large visual effects that what they bring is not necessarily\nI know how to use this software or that software.\nThat's really not what's important. It's the eye, it's\nthe attention to detail. It's the ability\nto articulate in language, visual things\nexplicitly right to someone else, to code something in a way that explicitly results in something that is, you know,\nvery precisely, controlled. Right. That's that's what it's about. So those people who are facial animators and modelers\nand compositors, doing traditional visual, they're taking to AI generative\nAI like a duck to water. It is just it's wonderful to see\nbecause the ones who just are that's really like,\nif you're a seeker, if you're passionate and you see this stuff, it's like, oh my God, this just unlocks\nso much more that I can do. You know, I've seen people\nthat enjoy what they're doing now. I am at a place like I'm having fun again. I have not said that\nfor a very long time, by the way, but it really is extraordinary\nto see this. And so, look, are things changing? Yes. You know, will job skills change? Yes. You know, will certain functions and tasks\ngo away? Yes. Will new things emerge? Absolutely. And they're happening every day. We are not even scratching the surface\nof what this stuff can do, right? Creatively. And\nand that's also what's exciting about it. And other people are making\nincredibly exciting tools as well. And when you start to see creatives\nnow rise up and start to be able to work across a panel of just powerful things, we are going to start to see some things in the world pretty soon\nthat are going to be extraordinary. You you mentioned scratching the surface. We've only begun to scratch it. But then where should we draw the line? You know, when using generative\nAI to create digital versions of people, whether they're real or fictional,\nhow do we create the parameters? Well, that's a tough thing\nto talk to an artist about. I don't know, I always try\nto just go out of the lines, right? I don't I don't know that the\nI think the, the lines are, law and order. I think there is, you know,\npublic decency. There is kind of kind of some moral, ethical obligation\nto not poisoning people's minds. That's, you know,\nwe're seeing increasingly difficult. I don't know that there, I would\nlook at that in this sort in that way. I, I look at this is, you know, at a certain point,\nyou know, change is the only constant. It's inevitable. We are going through it constantly, it’s\njust happening a lot faster right now. I don't ever think about drawing lines\nand like, clinging to the past like, Oh, no, I'm staying here. It's like, no, I'm jumping in like, so. So this is going to go to another place\nI think we're going to go to. Formats are going to change for sure. Distribution channels\nabsolutely will change because they already change anyway\nconstantly. So that's\nthat's just ever changing distribution. New business\nmodels are emerging all over the place. I think the supply chain that creates\ncontent in the world right now, right now, classic Hollywood, great content,\nMadison Avenue advertising, great quality content\nis going to go through a renaissance. But it is going to be very disruptive. Because it's on, game on right now. And I think you're going to start\nto see creativity surge. I'm seeing it already.\nWell with that creativity surging. I know the huge\ncreative potential is one thing, but what are the more sinister\nimplications of this, Ed? You know, again, person\ndating a major celebrity is over here. You know, the deepfake that we talked\nabout before, that's one thing. But thinking about security, government,\nglobal business, that's where this can really get scary.\nWhat are your thoughts on that? Well, I'm not an expert on this. And I, for my own mental health,\ntry not to, you know doom spiral? Very often. Sometimes it is very difficult. I'm clearly aware of the power of media\nand its impact. I also have, you know, I have, teenagers, you know, I'm, you know,\nthe living focus group for some of this. I do think ethical\nand moral guardrails are important. There's horrible things, right. And it isn't necessarily\njust for the kind of AI is like science. I mean, it's just it's\njust a vast spectrum of different things. We're one slice of that. But but similar things in that slice,\nyou know, you can take any of these tools and, and,\nyou know, have medical breakthroughs. You know, we've seen\nwe've seen that, science breakthrough, research breakthrough. Yeah. Just but at the same time, you know,\nthere's, there's that other of that other world and, and that's the super evil\nversion of thing. But okay, now we get guardrails. Guardrails are absolutely necessary,\nvery important here. But let's bring it back to the good,\nwhich is the space where you really seem to thrive. You're coming at this\nfrom a very virtuous space, Ed. So as you're saying, what are you most excited about\nfor this technology going forward? What's AI realism\ngoing to be like five years from now? I'm all about directors, directors, production\ndesigners, visual effects supervisors. You know that the people who make worlds\nand images and characters and people. So to me, that's super exciting and fun.\nThat always has been. But putting these tools in those hands, that is just mind blowing and and I am, I,\nyou know, super fortunate, very lucky guy to be able now\nto sit with, like, my heroes, like people that to me are some of the world's\ngreatest filmmakers, like major people that are seeking\nthis out, that are interested, that are and to just see what they're doing with\nit is just like, God, that's incredible. That's what is exciting. And seeing it change so fast\nand seeing someone grab it and use it this way, and someone else\ngrab it and use it that way. And us helping enable that. And through that, innovation comes. So there is something incredibly\nintoxicating about that spirit of innovation. That's where we're at is it just unlocks\nthe creative, you know, self blockers. Right. And and it's fun. It's fun. What a fantastic conversation this was. We were just so thrilled to have you. So I also want to give you this chance\nto talk about anything else that you want the people\nwho are listening to go check out. What are you working\non? Well, go see Here. An amazing film,\nincredible story, moving, powerful, beautifully executed\nand proud to have been a part of it. And then, you know, the new stuff\nI can't tell you about. But stay tuned. Watch this space. You know, ramping, we’re in production\nright now on a colossal, epic undertaking. And, you know, this coming this fall. Watch this space as well,\nnot just in the movie theaters. You know, with Marshall Mathers\nyou know, we did the first live generative\nAI on live television on the VMAs. So that's in the world\nnow. That's a thing. And so as we go forward,\njust keep your eye out. You're going to see some really fun stuff\ncoming this fall. You know, in, film and television\nand, and advertising, you're going to see some, some\nfun, some very fun stuff. As we come into the big, media holiday\nseason. Friends, that's it for today's\nepisode of AI and action. And I know that you all learned\na ton from that one, so please stay tuned here for more and we'll see you back\nhere again very, very soon."
