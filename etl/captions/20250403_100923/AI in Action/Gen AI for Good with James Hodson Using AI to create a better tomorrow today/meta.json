Do you know  where to go to recharge your devices\nwhen the power has been out for 20 hours?  Are you able to communicate\nwith other people in your society?  How the hell do you find out\nwhat benefits you're entitled to from the international community\nor from your government? Because of the situation\nthat you find yourself in when you've been in a blackout\nfor three days? In a world where AI is a terrifying, culture changing behemoth,\nis there another side to the story? A side where AI is actually out there\nmaking positive change and impacting humanity for the better? My guest today, James\nHodson, would like to believe so. He's a researcher, leader\nand entrepreneur, as well as the visionary behind\nAI for Good. James, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to AI in action. Fantastic pleasure to be here,\nto be with you today. Thank you so much for inviting me.\nFor sure. We're going to really enjoy\npicking your brain, but first we're going to start\nwith the elephant in the room. We know that\nAI is scary to a lot of people. So when did you start to think that\ninstead it could also be a force for positive change and good? Fantastic question.\nIt's been a really long journey. The foundation was started around\nten years ago, but the idea that we need to use\ntechnology in society in more sustainable ways\nand to effectively attack kind of challenges that we face, is\nsomething that's age old, right? It's not something that we came up\nwith. For us, it was in the late 90s. Over time, right during the 2000s,\nand you have to remember with AI, we've had multiple waves\nof the expectation of commercialization and the anticipation that AI\nis going to transform the universe. And it's been like that since the 50s,\nand now we're in a wave where we are actually seeing\nstructural, transformative change with the technologies,\nand it's extremely exciting. It's also, for many people,\nseeing it in person, right, interacting with technologies that their parents\neven would not have been able to imagine or seeing a self-driving car stop for them at a crossroads in a city, it's a little bit,\nyou know, takes them aback. And I can see why people would be anxious\nabout what could happen next. For us, that's what, that vacuum in terms\nof the understanding of how technology interacts with society, was the reason\nfor starting our organization. We wanted to be the providers\nof expertise, kind of a backbone for society to understand how to best utilize emerging technologies\nin a way that's going to strengthen our resilience, it's\ngoing to strengthen our communities. It's going to make us better\nproblem solvers overall. It's going to make us better able to use\nthe resources that we have on this earth, which are not infinite, in order\nto give our children a better future right, and live more harmoniously together\nso that we're actually building a positive, forward\nlooking force in the world. I love that overall commitment. Give me some examples though. I want to hear what are some ways\nthat you've really found that you can use\nAI for forces of positivity? Our mission\nas an organization can be best described as economic and community resilience through technology. And it's the through technology lens\nwhich changes kind of how we think about what we're doing. In the back,\nwe are, yes, technologists, right. And I've been a researcher\nin AI for two decades, and I've worked across\na whole variety of problems, and I've seen a lot of what can be done\nwith the technologies. But we are also economists and economists\nare people who study human behavior. They study the structure of society\nand try to understand what kinds of changes\nwill have the impact that we desire, and what's the most effective way\nof achieving that end result. You have to bring those two parts together\nin order to have an impact on the world. You can't just design a technology and expect that it's going to go out there\nand have good. You need to do it in context. You can't design a strategy\nfor a whole nation state and their approach\nto technology and society, and how they can attack certain challenges\nthat they're facing without actually\nbeing within that community. We prefer to strengthen the communities\nwith the skills and the resources\nand the ideas that are required. So that they can build things\nfor themselves that are going to have a long\nlasting impact on adoption. Now, let me dive into the examples\nthat you asked for. A few years ago, we were approached\nby the Tony Blair Institute, based in London, to work with them\nand the government of Ethiopia in order to develop a forward thinking strategy for the next 10, 20 years of economic development\nand societal transformation in Ethiopia. We’ll detach this conversation from how Ethiopia has developed\npolitically since that stage. So, for example, in Ethiopia,\nthey have the same amount of internet bandwidth\nfor the whole country. As a few blocks\naround my house in California. Imagine how that constrains your ability\nin the modern world to build an innovative society\nthat's solving its own challenges. It's a massive bottleneck, right? People actually don't need much\nto be entrepreneurial problem solvers in the modern world, right? Laptop, good internet connection, and... good coffee, right? Right. When you are lacking\none of these kind of foundational columns. Right.\nYou need to start thinking about how can you quickly\nget infrastructure in place. It turns out the strong internet backbone\nand that kind of infrastructure is actually really important\nwhen it comes to health care. In a country that's as massive\nas Ethiopia, with you know, more than 100 million people, most of them living in\nrural areas, most of them farming, right? Most of them not really having\nany background in technology and not thinking about opportunity\nthrough a technological lens. You need to actually reach them\nas a first stage. So a lot of what we\nthen ended up thinking about was, what's the basic infrastructure\nthat you need to put in place first, and how do you get people on board\nwith these ideas? So that's the first example\nthat a lot of the work we do actually is kind of advocacy oriented in communities to make them understand\nthat the transformative or the foundational layer\nthat they need in order to be able to build with technology,\nbe able to transform their society, it's not that far away from where they are now, but you do need some resources\nin order to enable that to take place. Another example on the other side,\nwe're very involved in Ukraine. Now, you know, obviously\nsome of the viewers will have seen that. I'm wearing a, rather bright outfit today. Right. Now, this is a traditional\nUkrainian Vyshyvanka. Right. It's an ornate set of patterns\nrelated to particular regions of Ukraine. And for us, as an organization, we started to enable better solutions\nto these challenges. Right. 2014, they were ratified by the United Nations. And that's when we also started. And that's the taxonomy that we use\nfor thinking about the problems\nthat we want to solve in the world. And if there's one thing in the world\nright now which is causing us to fall even further behind on\nachieving these goals, it's the fact that we have massive conflicts\nthat are liable to spill over and are already having deep\neconomic effects around the world. So we use the fact that, we have the technology expertise,\nthe scalability expertise to solve problems,\nto also help in Ukraine. We have 50 staff on the ground. We have about eight different locations\nthat we work across, and we're active with the entire Ukrainian government and\nevery municipal authority in the country, which means that we're developing technologies that are used by Ukrainians\non a daily basis. We're developing strategies and policies\nbased on data analysis and machine learning\nand and AI to enable the Ukrainian economy\nto withstand the invasion. In all of known history,\nwhenever there's been an all out invasion of a country, there has been a collapse\nof the banking system, for instance. And you need banks in Ukraine\nbecause of the way that the economy was being managed. There was no run on the banks,\nthere was no crisis in the banking system. It's one of the few examples of where\ngood economic thinking actually was able\nto prevent something that could have then led to a much, much,\nmuch deeper set of problems. And as a result, you actually have\na functioning society, right? Still. And that means that we're able to go in\nand use technology to advance that. Of course, if you didn't have that layer\nof well-operating, well-oiled society, then you would have challenges putting AI\nand other technologies into place. And all of this starts, of course, as you\nmentioned, with the strong foundation, you've got to have that infrastructure\nthat’s set on up and then you can build. Can you give me some more ideas in terms of\nhow can we think about AI outside of the the traditional scope of productivity\nand actually enhance that? I love this because, you know,\nwe're, we're getting into conversations that impinge both upon\nkind of modern economic thinking and how we understand society and our relationship\nwith productivity and growth. And so we use measures like GDP, right,\nand GDP is an economic measure. It shows you basically how money cycles\nthrough the economy, right. And how quickly it moves around\nright from the available pool of capital. It's not actually a very good measure of how productive human beings are. So we have these measures\nthat are kind of divorced from, you know, how productive\nare we being sat here? Right. Maybe it's a net negative. We don't have good ways of\nknowing what accelerates our ability to solve the problems that are important,\nor reduce the amount of energy that we need to expend\nto solve the problem. Right? Or to make a sale or to develop\na new product or to build infrastructure. We don't know actually what\nthe relationship is between how many hours we work and how much we're paid,\nand what actually we're building in society, and how much closer\nwe are to achieving what we want. So I try to step back from that and not worry\ntoo much about the productivity angle, because it's not useful\nfor actually putting technology into the context where it can be used\nfor societal transformation. So I'm going to take an example. Imagine that you have a war.\nThere's a lot of uncertainty. How do you find the resources\nthat you need in order to stay calm, stay productive, stay alive, and thrive as much as possible\nand in such a situation. So you might imagine, okay, do you know where to go to get medicine\nwhen your child gets sick? Do you know where to go to recharge your devices\nwhen the power has been out for 20 hours? Are you able to communicate\nwith other people in your society? How the hell do you find out what benefits you're entitled\nto from the international community or from your government because of\nthe situation that you find yourself in when you've been in a blackout\nfor three days? However, also consider outside here, right in New York City. How do people find out about\nthe opportunities that they're entitled to? How do they make good decisions\nabout their plan, plans for the future? How do they make sure they're getting\nthe training that they need and the support that they need\npsychologically? Right, in terms of family planning,\nin terms of their relationships with, with the community\nand how they actually interact. Can you give me some more examples\nof how AI for good works? Maybe on not as large of a scale,\nbut a little bit more intimately. So we've,\nwe've had the pleasure of working also on a very municipal level,\nright, around the world, including in Brazil and Canada,\nhere in the US and Europe, looking at ways that we can understand\nand analyze the challenges that are being faced in the community\nand respond to challenges, but in a way that then\nwe can take those solutions and potentially scale them to other places\nthat that need them. For example, in British Columbia,\nwe played a role in developing what is now an interconnected\nwildfire mitigation system, which allows all of the different agencies\nthat are needed in order to respond to potential situations\nwhere fires get out of control in a way that's coordinated\nand in a way that gives them the information\nthat they need in real time. This is the type of thing\nwhere it's not just about artificial intelligence,\nit's about the underlying infrastructure. It's about the hardware. Right. What are your ground observation beacons? How are you getting the overall view\nof the situation that's happening? How are you choosing where\nto put resources so that you can respond most quickly to a specific point\nwhere the flare up is most likely? Also, how do you maybe\nidentify ahead of these situations where the risks are so that again, you're\nbeing proactive about mitigating risks rather than dealing with a fire,\nwhich is obviously much more costly, much more dangerous,\nand is going to lead to much more damage, to people's lives,\nby having to live through it. On the other hand, we can go to\nanother example, which is workplace. So workplace equality. Right. We have as one of the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, gender equality. And today, as a society, we're still very,\nvery far behind on this goal. So for women in particular,\nit is very difficult to achieve the same career success as men. And it's more difficult today than it was\nten years ago. How do you attack this kind of situation? We're not going to be able to get into\nthe DNA of every single company and really solve it\non an individual basis. But one thing we can do with technology\nis we can bring more transparency to the signals\nthat people can use in order to understand the culture of a company, in order\nto understand the current structure and how that might be contributing\nto outcomes, and by doing that,\nby bringing transparency to an area, we can change the approach\nthat corporate leaders take to managing their culture and make them\nfocus on these questions more. So that's the economic idea behind it. With technology,\nwell, AI is fantastic at aggregating data. It's also fantastic\nat identifying patterns that we might not be able to see, or precursors to patterns\nthat we're not going to be able to associate, right,\nwith kind of manual, old school traditional methods and so one thing that\nwe do is we work with a variety of data partners, including organizations\nthat have been collecting, you know, resumé and job applications\nfor decades in order to look at the relationship\nbetween hiring and companies, the structure,\nthe internal structure of those companies and how promotions happen\nand how people are rewarded for their work, and also how happy\npeople are, within these organizations. One thing that we're now coming\nkind of to the to the point where we're going to be releasing it\npublicly is a scorecard of tens of thousands of companies\nin the US by metrics that are important to understanding whether this is\na culturally good fit for somebody. So a culturally good fit\nfrom the perspective of an employee, culturally good fit\nfrom the perspective of an investor, and culturally good fit\nfrom the perspective of a customer. You shine a light\nand let the market show the way forward. Right. And so what we also try to do with\ntechnology is to bring more light to these areas. I'd say it's less about saying\nAI needs a special way of doing things than, well, let's look at, you know,\nhow do other engineering disciplines\ncope with risk and risk mitigation? When we build a bridge, for instance,\ndo we go out there, kind of stand right looking across the chasm and think,\nall right, you know, I think I need a piece of steel\nthat's about 600ft long. All right, let's see,\nlet's see what happens. Right?\nUsually we don't do it that way. It's not that we are saying\nthat we should do something wildly different with AI, but computer\nscience in general has avoided being pinned down\nas an engineering discipline for decades. Now, when we think of critical\ninfrastructure in society, it's not highways,\nrail, electrical, water. You know, it's\ncyber and communications, right? That is pretty much the underpinning of everything else that we're doing now\nbecause it goes away. And you don't have a banking sector\nanymore, you're not going to have reliable water supply\nbecause it's all being basically managed by an interconnected information system. Right. The electrical grid\nis going to be able to balance your power. You're going to have surges that break\nall of your appliances at home. That backbone has been built\nby computer scientists, by AI scientists, by statisticians. And it's an engineering discipline. You know,\nwe should have come to terms with the fact that it was a real engineering discipline and put proper procedures\nin place decades ago. But the reality is we've always treated it\nas ah, it's like an art, right? Programing is an art, right? It's an art\nthat apparently we think is possible to just come out of a language model\nbecause it's artistic, right. So we're going to generate it and it will kind of approximate\nthe thing that we want it to do. But we need to constrain that art, just\nlike bridge building is an art now, right? We have many beautiful bridges,\nbut it's also, at its core, a mathematical engineering\nbased discipline that needs to have rules about\nhow we go about identifying the problem that we're solving, ensuring\nthat we know right and can trust all of our understanding of the base\nthat we're building upon. Just like you wouldn't\nbuild a bridge on quicksand. Oh, it didn't look like quicksand\nwhen when I was observing it. We need to make sure\nthat we're doing the right thing. We need to test things\nappropriately at scale. Right. So start small, build up. And we need to ensure that when we're\neducating people, when we're building the next generation of people\nwho are going to work in this discipline, that we are not only giving them the mathematical scientific knowledge\nthat they require, but that we're immersing them\nin how to solve problems in society. And when we have that type of thinking,\nyou know, what else will happen? What's that? They're going to see other opportunities that go beyond\nwhat they're doing in their job. It won't just be,\noh, I've got to deploy a chat bot today that responds to questions on behalf of,\nthis podcast on our website. It's going to be, well, you know,\nwhen I was walking into work, I saw that, you know, there's clearly an inefficiency\nin how we're, you know, managing\nkind of pedestrian routes during construction\nor something like that. You know, we start to provide people with a basis for thinking more broadly\nabout their skills and capabilities within the community and society,\nand we engage with them on this level. And, you know, people\nnaturally want to solve problems. And I think that we need\nmore of this approach. On a practical level, can an individual\ncoder start to use AI for good today? I think\nwe're at a really interesting time. So I started programing in, the mid 90s. Right. And there was magic\nwhen I started programing, and I realized that I was one individual with a toolset that could scale\nand touch people around the world. Once you internalize that, it's\nextremely empowering. And it was true in the 90s\nas well as it's true today. But today we can harness per person thousands of kilowatt hours\nmore in electricity than I was able to harness in the 90s to solve problems,\nwhich means that we can solve problems now at an unprecedented scale,\nas an individual, right? We have ability to tap into resources\nthat no single person would have been able to access with their idea\nat any point in history before. And ultimately, you know,\nif we put it in crude terms, innovation and the economy is about energy\nconsumption, okay? And what we're doing right now with AI is we're consuming energy, which is allowing us to build solutions,\nright, with small teams that are extremely sophisticated\nand have far reaching potential. It sounds like you're placing\na lot on intention, on focus in terms of how we can use AI. Businesses and nonprofits, sometimes\ntheir interests don't always align. So how can we think about AI for good? Both your organization,\nbut then also the theory, the philosophy. If you're a business person\nwho's listening to this right now, if you're a person\nwho's really focused on the bottom line in the business right now,\nhow can all of this make sense for them? Right now in the United States,\nbecause of the unequal access to technology\nand opportunity, education, health care, infrastructure, there is an enormous\namount of untapped economic potential in the US from people that have been\ndisenfranchized from the system. If as a corporation,\nyou focus in on helping to solve the challenges in society\nthat have impacted that, it will actually unlock\nan enormous amount of economic value. Because ultimately, what is a society if only half of it is contributing\nto solving a problem? Right? Without the private sector, governments\ntoday don't have the expertise\nor really the ability because of kind of political deadlock\nin some sense, to really fundamentally rethink\nhow we solve problems. While in some sense corporate America,\nthe NGOs, civil society\nmore broadly has a level of flexibility that allows us to not be constrained\nby special interests. And employees\nat these corporations have even more power because ultimately\nthey hold the keys to the engine, right? And the engine needs to work\nfor everybody, right? Not not just for kind of a powerful elite\nat the top. There are benefits that come from\noperating in a community with an attitude of that community being consequential\nto your business in the future, right? Not a resource to be used, but an effective network in which we can operate\nto bring positive outcomes for all. Positive outcomes for all. I'm going to take that now, and I want to go back to where we started\nthis conversation. There's a lot of fear surrounding AI. Why should we not be as afraid\nas we are excited? We are at a time where\nif we can invest more as a society in creating with, creating the precedents with technology\nthat underpin big solutions to grand challenges\nlike climate change. Which obviously is, you know, a framework problem\nthat we all need to be thinking about, not just from, you know, how do we capture\ncarbon in the atmosphere at scale, but also what are we doing every day\nin our own lives that's impacting this? And what technology can play a role\nin bringing that to the forefront of people's attention\nand so on. I've always been in a situation\nthroughout my life and career where the technology that I'm using\ncould have power to do good and power to do bad\nin catastrophic ways on both sides. And yet we have always chosen\nas society, eventually, the path of hope and positive outcomes from the technology\nrather than the path of destruction. And I think that we will continue\nto choose this in the future. Again, that doesn't mean that\nwe don't need to be eternally vigilant. You can be pretty positive\nabout the amazing things that we're going to be able to achieve\nover the coming years and decades. You know what? I kind of want to just keep that\nas a mantra now. So, James,\nthank you for such an enlightening but also a very encouraging conversation\ntoday. I believe,\nand I really hope, that everybody who's been joining us in this conversation\nhas also found this equally empowering. So thank you again so much for joining us. It matters. Folks, AI for Good is a nonprofit,\nso their funding does come from people like you and me. So please go check out their website\nand consider donating at aiforgood.org. Again, thank you all for joining\nus. We'll see you next time."
