So today I want to talk about how data\nand data preparation really make AI fly, how it makes it soar, but especially as\nit comes to fantasy football. So I'm thrilled to have the perfect folks\nfor the job right here. Legendary ESPN anchor\nand host of ESPN's Get Up, Mike Greenberg and senior executive, sports and entertainment sponsorship\nmarketing at IBM, Elizabeth O'Brien. Mike and Elizabeth,\nI'm stoked that you're here today. Well, thank you for having us. Yes.\nThank you. Well, let's get into it. Okay. So, Mike, I want to start off with you\nand Elizabeth, of course, jump on in here, please. It feels like fantasy football might be an even bigger deal\nthan football to some folks these days. It's, like, really woven itself\ninto the fabric of society. So I'm curious about how you think\nthat fantasy football has changed the relationship\nbetween fans and football. There are so many more people\nwho are interested in football today, because they can have\nthis direct involvement, because they can actually be\na part of the game in a real and meaningful way\nthan there would otherwise have been. When we look at the causes\nfor the explosion of popularity of pro football in this country,\nI would put that right at or near the top. So I think it's important to say\nit's also become a business, right. And it's a business\nthat's now a driver of business. Right. So for ESPN and the other fantasy\nfootball platforms, it drives consumption. It drives consumption of ESPN shows. It drives consumption of ESPN editorial\nand it drives consumption of NFL merch, watching on Sunday,\nall sorts of discussions. A whole cottage industry\nhas grown up around fantasy football. And so for ESPN,\nit is an important business platform for them too, because it helps their other\nexisting businesses. So we've heard some now about\nwhy it's important to ESPN that makes complete sense. How and why is it important to IBM though? How does IBM get in the mix with all this? Well, we have a partnership with ESPN. So ESPN is a business just like\nany other business we partner with. And their objective is to make\ntheir platform the best it can be. Make the best experience for ESPN fantasy\nfootball managers. And so we use technology\nto help them do that. And we've been doing that since 2017. And every year we build on top of what\nwe did the previous year. So it is the first instance\nof AI in fantasy football. And every year\nthere are developments in AI. And so we bring those developments\nto the ESPN fantasy platform. I've been lucky enough to be a part of this program\nwith Elizabeth and all of the team at IBM. I think almost since its inception,\nand I have been flabbergasted. I mean, each year I sit as they go through\nall of the new technology, all of the new things that can be offered. I remember when we're starting\nto assess trades and then, I mean, I've watched\nall these things grow. And so the evolution of it\nhas been remarkable. It's actually how I have learned\nabout the growth of AI in our country, in a much more general macro way,\nbecause I am flabbergasted at the amount of information\nthat is now available at your fingertips in the blink of an eye\nthrough ESPN and IBM's program, even versus what there was when we started\ndoing this a few years ago. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's a good compliment\nbecause ESPN has so much information, so many experts, so much information\nprinted, so much data, so many statistics that it actually almost creates an embarrassment of riches for people\nwho are playing fantasy football. So what we're doing\nis we're using technology to say, hey, ESPN,\nthere's all this great data out there. You have all these great experts. Let us help boil that down\nand make sort of a digestible experience for Fantasy Football Manager\nas they set their lineup week to week, or as they evaluate waiver\nwire pickups or trades. Well,\nwith all that data, then, like you said, it seems like it's an embarrassment\nof riches, right? So that's a lot of work\nfor y'all to do in order to boil it down, how is that impacting the fans? What are fans doing with all of this data,\nand how is that changing their relationship with football,\nbut also with fantasy football? So I'll just start with what what we're doing specifically,\nwhen you think about your your fantasy football lineup, there are ways, you know,\nthere are injuries there by weeks, etc. so you're constantly having to shift it\nover the 17 or 18 weeks of the season. And there are a few ways to alter your\nyour roster. You can take someone off the bench,\nof course, and you want to know\nif they're likely to boom or bust. So Watsonx is helping to evaluate the boom\nand bust potential of players, so you can decide whether you're going\nto leave them on the bench or start them. But you can also pick up players\nthrough the waiver wire. If there's a player on the waiver, well, is that wide receiver really better\nthan who I've got on my team? I need some help with that, right? And so if we can boil down,\nyou know, millions of pieces of data into a single waiver\ngrade, right, and say, you know what, this this wide receiver is an 89 and you're\naverage wide receiver grade is a 77. So this is a pretty good pickup, right? So that's what we started doing\nand this year, what's new is we're saying here's why. We're sort of opening that black box\nand using generative AI to identify the contributing factors. Here's why that person got an 89 grade. Because they're facing this defense. Because they've boomed the last three games, because, you know,\nwhatever the reasons are. So it's actually it's\nsimplifying down to a grade, but then it's expanding and explaining itself\nthrough generative AI to fantasy managers. What they are doing is synthesizing\nan amount of information that is infinitely beyond anything\nmy brain is capable of processing. And frankly,\nanyone's brain is capable of processing. The fascinating piece of this is\nthey're not just looking at numbers that can be found in other places,\nbut they are also synthesizing what people are saying\nthey're taking into account what's being written in the columns,\nin the local newspapers, on the websites, what people on talk\nshows like mine are saying. All those get sort of mixed\ninto this extraordinary stew and out\ncome the probabilities of boom and bust. And is this player\na good pick up for this week? But perhaps after that week you're going\nto want to make another change. The amount of information that you can receive from\nthis is endless and extraordinary. And the comparison I would make to it. You know, when I was young and I first learned about the stock market, I first learned\nabout the stock market was I thought, well, I really like this company\nand I really like this brand of car. So I'm going to buy those stocks. And what I quickly realized was,\nI don't know what the entire rest of the world likes\nand is going to like. So the comparison I would make to that is you can play fantasy football\njust to have fun if you want to. And there's nothing wrong with that. And if you want to do that\nand just pick players that you like because they're on your team\nand you want to root for them, there's nothing wrong with that. But if you want to play competitively,\nif you want to win, just as is the case in the stock market,\nthen you would be very, very foolish not to take into account\nas much data as you possibly can. I think we were playing a couple years ago with Eli Manning\nwhen he learned that lesson. It was right after he retired\nand he drafted his former teammates and very quickly\nwould drop to the bottom of our league. So he very he had to do some trades\nand waiver pickups. Those are hard lessons\nto learn even for fans. Like I started out,\nI'm a fan of the New York Jets. So I started out, I said I will not draft\nany New England Patriots no matter what happens. And I took as many Jets as I possibly\ncould, and I had the worst team in the league\nour first year. And these are lessons\nyou have to learn the hard way. Unless you listen to podcasts\nlike this one and realize, oh, you're telling me that through Watsonx,\nthere is an endless array of data? Again, if you just want to play to have\nfun, there's nothing wrong with that. But if you really want to try to compete,\nif that is important to you, then there's just no way in the world\nyou can do it. If you're not using\nthis kind of information and you're competing\nagainst people who are. And what's fantasy football without a little competition,\na little friendly competition. Yeah. So, Greeny, you just said one thing that I just wanted to pick up on is,\nyou know, the stock market. And I know that your example was sort of\nyou with cars and stock prices, but it's fair to say that this is the same technology we're using\nfor industries outside of sports. And fantasy football itâ€™s basically\nhow do you make decisions? How do you synthesize vast amounts of data to make the best possible decision\nin any industry? Because any business that you're running\nis going to require information,\nis going to require decisions. So for you, is trusting the data versus trusting your gut always a better thing? Where are we sitting on that spectrum? The gut is a big problem, okay? People who trust their\ngut are the ones who lose all the time. Here's what I will say. Let's line up ten people, okay? And five of them, five of them\nare going to play trusting the data. And the other five of them\nare going to play trusting their gut. And then you watch how that works out. And then ask me that question again. And it's really as simple as that. Look, Moneyball in some ways is the\nis the predecessor of this or it's they're they're from the same family.\nThey're from the same tree. The teams themselves and the leagues\nthemselves are using this information as well. It's, I mean Daryl Morey,\nI think is who's the general manager now of the Philadelphia 76ers from Northwestern University\nby the way quick plug my alma mater. But but but he is was one of the first. He is credited as being one of the first\nto really bring a the analytics heavily into the NBA. And the game has changed enormously. I know\nwe're talking about fantasy football, but if you remember\nwhat basketball looked like 20 years ago,\nthey weren't shooting threes all the time. Now that's all you do because they've\nrecognized that threes and layups. It just makes sense mathematically. The data suggests that you will win\nfar more often doing that than you will win if you play the way\nthe game had always been played. Spin that directly to this. You could play with your gut,\nand if you play that over the course of a 17 week season,\nyou'll win once. But you know you can also,\nif you're playing blackjack, hit on 18 and you might win once, but that doesn't\nmake it the right thing to do. The point I'm making is I strongly discourage\nthe use of the gut in decision making. When it comes to matters like this. Nine times out of ten, the gut will lose. I want to dig into a little bit\nabout the importance of the speed. Like how quickly can\nall of this data get processed and why is that a relevant thing\nwhen it comes to fantasy football? Because people have\nto make these decisions rather quickly. It's more relevant\nnow than it has ever been. And I mean that quite literally\nfor this coming season, as they are now going to start playing games\non almost every day of the week. So it used to be\nthere was a time where you could, okay, I'll wait until Friday\nand I'll set my roster for this week because they're going to be games\non Sunday and one on Monday night. Well, now we've added a Thursday\nnight game every single week. Now there are a bunch of games\nthat are going to be played on Saturdays. This year\nthey're going to be Wednesday games. So this is information, injury updates,\nall those sorts of things. These are decisions that will have to be made almost\nin real time, almost in real time football is not quite like basketball\nor baseball where there are a game there's a game literally every day,\nbut there is almost a game every day of the week in the NFL\nthis coming year, and there will be some weeks\nwhere there practically are, so that I think that the value\nof getting that data and information quickly has never been more significant\nthan it will be for this upcoming season. Right, and so stats don't update\nas quickly as natural language, right? Because there are pundits out there talking about, well, on Friday\nthis might happen or this just happened. Right. And so it's the ability\nto get into language and to understand how that language translates\nto data translates to a decision factor. And that's what Watsonx and Granite are\nhelping to do in ESPN fantasy football. When we started this partnership in 2017,\nI didn't know what Gen AI was. I mean, I'm sure it existed somewhere,\nbut but not not in my world, you know? So we were just focusing on boom\nand bust, right? Is this person\ngoing to exceed their projection or are they going to fall short? And we were using AI just for that\nvery simple decision making. Now we are evaluating trades\nwhich are complex, you know, exchanges of value basically. And we are evaluating waiver pickups\nand we're doing it in a personalized way. So it's not just that\nthis wide receiver is great. It's this wide receiver is great for your team because your wide receivers\nare falling short. And so we think that's great. But Greeny might have\nall great wide receivers. And that same wide receiver\nwould get a 50 grade for him. So it's personalization, itâ€™s the use of\nlarge language models like Granite. It's the use of Watsonx to explain why, decisions\nand recommendations are being made. But Greeny, I don't know if... It's all well\nbeyond my ability to comprehend. I enjoy seeing the data, I use it,\nI've come to use it religiously. And at this point,\nI would never make a decision in our league or any league that I might\nplay in without using Watsonx. But for the life of me,\nI couldn't explain to you how they do it. And in fact, I have many times met\nthe gentleman who actually was responsible or at least credited for having started\nall of this, and he's so smart that I can't even have\na conversation with him. To be completely honest with you, if you've ever wanted to feel like\nthe dumbest person in the room, have a conversation with him\nabout the question you just asked. I think he uses some of that smarts\nto just confuse you two if you're playing. But he also won the league.\nI mean, that's the thing. Like he's not he's walking the walk. He's not just talking the talk. He wins every year\nbecause he knows what he's doing. But all kidding aside, to go back to what I was thinking about\nwhen Elizabeth was saying that is in a real way, these are business\ndeals that we're making, right? I mean, they are actually business\ntransactions. A trade is like a business transaction,\nand you would never make a business transaction without taking into account\nall of the factors that are involved. There's risk. There's there's what's my high\nend success here? What's my low end risk here? What am I giving up?\nWhat am I getting back in return? What is the probability of this\nworking out best for me that's the information\nthat you're getting. No one can tell you with certainty things\nthat are going to happen. If you knew that,\nthen you know you I would you would. I wouldn't be sitting here. I'd be living\non an island of my own ownership. With all the watches that you want. Playing a golf course\nthat only I can play. But what you are, what you are getting is the most educated guessing possible. Like,\nthere is no more educated speculation that you can get literally anywhere else. And why wouldn't you utilize that\nin any business transaction? Yeah. I mean, it's just it's massive\namounts of data and the data points to, you know, certain insights\nand certain conclusions. Of course, they're going to go and play\nthe game anyway just to see what happens. But going in sort of understanding\nall the variables really helps you to be\nin the best possible position. So I'll give you another example. That's a non fantasy example\nfrom an IBM perspective. You know we partner\nwith Augusta National at the Masters. And this year\nwe had a feature called Hole Insights. And we were using Watsonx\nto identify zones on the course. And what usually happens\nwhen you land in the zone on the course. The odds of making birdie par\nbogey from certain locations, right. There is a lot of sort of feel in golf\nand sort of a lot of experience in golf. But we also heard from caddies,\nfrom players, from commentators that they were actually using our data\nto help them understand how the course might play, where to look\nfor really exciting spots on the course, and outlooks for how the how the round\non that particular day may play out. So it's a mix. It's a mix. It's art and science. It's wild to really see that\nmix happen in real time too, you know? And then, you know, as you mentioned,\nof course, it impacts how the fans are looking at things as they are\ntruly looking at the seats. But I'm just imagine being a player\nand having a discussion with coach and understanding\nthat there's actual data behind now what I'm supposed to put into,\nlike my gut and my impulse. So what have you kind of heard\nfrom the player standpoint? Oh well, I mean,\nthe players are very well aware of this and they have been ahead of this\nto at least some degree. So every coach has tendencies. If you're calling a defense. Now we're talking about\nabout the actual football coaches here. If you're the opposing, you're Andy Reid,\nyou're the coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. And I'm the defensive coordinator\nof another team. And I know that on third\nand three or shorter your tendencies, the probability is you're going to do A,\nand if it doesn't work then you're going to check it to B. And so I'm going to prepare myself for A\nand B. And those are things that they have been\nanalyzing this kind of data with whatever they've had available to them for as long\nas these games have been played. And all of them are now every, every team in every sports league, including college,\nis using all of this data. I remember having a conversation\nwith the football coach at Northwestern about this, when I was trying\nto understand why it is, if you are down a certain amount of points in a game,\nthat we made a decision to go for two on, on a touchdown\nwhen I did not think it made sense, and he explained to me he went through\nall of the different probabilities. This is just data that is being run\nthat Elizabeth might be able to explain to you\nthat I most certainly could not. But the data suggests that far more often\nthan not, your best scenario is down 14 with X amount of time\nleft, you go for the two. Now your cognitive mind might say\nI'm much safer kicking the extra point to kick two extra points\nsend the game to overtime. But the data says that\nif you play this out a thousand times or a million times, or perhaps Watsonx\ncould tell you a trillion times, you will win more times\nby going for the two than not so. And almost all coaches do that. Now, there used to be coaches\nwho would coach by the gut. They used to call it. I mean, they used to say I never read\nthe book coaching by the book. I don't coach by the book.\nI don't read by the book. Those guys don't last anymore. There are almost none of those anymore. Data is making the decisions\nin all, in team building, in game strategy\nevery bit as much as it is in fantasy. Yeah. And so when you think those are coaches\nwith years of experience, right. Fantasy football\nmanagers are people like me, right? And I didn't play fantasy\nbefore we started this partnership. So I was relying very heavily on the data. Right. So you have to think,\nyou know, fantasy is for everyday people and some of them are great sports experts\nand some of them are not, right? But by unlocking the amount of data\nthat people with years of experience have, you even the playing field a little bit\nand you make it a lot more fun. Can you give us a little bit of insight\nin terms of how IBM crunches all of this data as quickly as it does? We work with ESPN year round. It's really a partnership where\nwe understand sort of what their need is. You know, people aren't trading enough. You know, a fun league is an active league\nand trading really drives activity, right? And makes\npeople want to come back for more and makes\npeople want to set their lineups more. I mean, it's not good for anybody if you don't set your lineup week to week\nand you're not actively playing. So that's how we ended up using technology for the trade analyzer, saying,\nokay, there's all this data out there. I would have to get into calculus terms that I have not thought about for years,\nbut there is a team led by a distinguished engineer at IBM,\nand they basically have a number of algorithms\nto pull in the data from ESPN. And again, I have to emphasize that\nunstructured data is really important. So that's language. It's not just stats. It's not just numbers and tables. It's you know what Greeny is saying on\nGet Up. It's what everyone else is saying\non all of the other shows. And that's what's new,\nyou know, it's using large language models to then turn that into data\nthat we can now express in plain language for people\nwho are playing fantasy football. And we can also express it\nin terms of numbers as well. So we use what's called a garage methodology,\nand we develop prototypes of the solution. And as the year goes on, we decide, okay, this is the one that's\ngoing to make a really good experience. And then we implement that every year. So it's really a year round process\nand starts with a business need or fan or fantasy manager experience need\nthat will differentiate ESPN. Well Mike hearing that,\nhow does it feel to know that you're a part of the unstructured\ndata that's being pulled on in? I, I be honest with you, that's\nmaybe two years now that we've been doing that or so I mean,\nthat's a relatively new phenomenon. Yeah. When I first learned that,\nI was really surprised. I mean, I was I was taken aback\njust at the ability to synthesize that. Think about how many words\nare being written and spoken every single day\nabout sports in this country. It boggles the mind. And somehow Watsonx is literally able\nto synthesize all of it. And not only that, but weigh the the value\nof some of it versus other of it. Well, that it's just\nI have to interrupt you for one second. That's really important\nbecause it has to be trusted data. And so that's\nsort of the strength of Watsonx, right. It's trusted data that is, you know,\nwe can't take in data that's not vetted or trusted. And then we have to govern that data.\nWe have to watch it. And we have to make sure that it doesn't\nit doesn't drift or start to hallucinate. There are humans involved\nto make sure that we're staying on track with the models throughout. And Greeny happens to be a trusted source. So he's back in that trusted data pile. So I'll let you continue. On and and but more to the point,\nthe people who are on my show are the ones that we trust. So I sit there\nand I'm surrounded every single day by two or 3 or 4 legitimate football experts,\npeople who played the game, who understand the dynamics of things that are going\non, that even the most avid fan. And here's the point about how this\ninformation factors in with the numbers. Even someone who has access to all of the\nthe hard data, whatever\none would describe all the statistics as, someone who played\nthe game will have an understanding of things that those people\nthat that those numbers may not tell. So that's why I was really fascinated\nthat it could do that. And I think\nthe value of it is overwhelming. And I can tell you how much more important\nit has become just from a content standpoint,\nwhich is the area that I specialize in. So, I mean, I've been at ESPN for 28 years\nand I started out anchoring SportsCenters,\nand I can tell you that in the late 90s, we had I would say we devoted less than 1% of our content time\nto the coverage of the fantasy angle of sports\nof any sport, much less football. But any sport, as this has evolved and as society,\nas I mentioned before, has evolved. We're we're now spending\nprobably closer to 20% of our content is is is aimed\nin that direction, aimed at people who are, specifically people\nwho are playing fantasy football. I'm talking about one out\nof every five words I speak on the air. I'm thinking about that person because that has become such\nan incredibly important part of the audience, and that's what\nthese people are looking for. I have a philosophy that the job of a talk show host is not to create\ninterest, it's to reflect it. So I'm not doing this\nbecause I want people to be interested in in fantasy football\nand in the information that you can get from Watsonx, I'm doing it\nbecause those people are interested in it, and that's what they want from shows\nlike mine. Well, I'm going to lean into something that I know that our listeners right now\nreally want from this particular episode. We're going to play a little game of gut\nversus data. Mike, I want you to tell us how your gut thinks\nthat your QB is going to do this season. By my QB, obviously\nyou mean Aaron Rodgers. Absolutely. Well, so Aaron\nRodgers is like a human madlib, right? Like he spent the offseason\nlike running for vice president maybe and then missed minicamp\nbecause he was in Egypt. Like these are this is like you've just filled in a madlib\nand somehow came up with all of these. Having said all of that,\nnow that the season is mercifully getting set to begin, if he is healthy,\nI think he is going to be terrific. He has and the Jets have all of the things that are required\nfor a quarterback to be successful. They should have an outstanding\nrunning game with a great running back in Breece Hall, who I think is going to go\n2 or 3 or at latest four in most drafts. They have a dynamic\nyoung star wide receiver in Garrett Wilson that I think he will have excellent\nchemistry with and other good weapons. They have a rebuilt and hopefully much better offensive line,\nand they also have a really good defense. The only thing about a defense,\nand this is where all the AI comes into play, is if your defense is really good,\nthen sometimes your offense is a little bit more conservative because your defense isn't giving up as many points, so\nyou're not going to throw as many passes. So all those things get factored in. And this is why asking me my gut is not nearly as useful as asking Watsonx, because Watsonx will take into account,\nwell, what if the Jets have the best defense in the NFL,\nwhich is a real possibility. How will that impact how many times a game\nAaron Rodgers throws the ball, how many touchdowns he throws for, how much they will just be looking to run out the clock\nin the second halves of these games. So that's,\nI think, a perfect example of where the gut might say one thing oh he's good. He's back. He's healthy. We got good\nplayers. We're going to be winning. Let's go and Watsonx\nmay very well tell you all those factors actually suggest that while the Jets will be good, Rodgers\nnumbers will not be nearly as good as those of another quarterback\nwhose team may stink on ice. But because they're losing all the time,\nhe's going to throw two meaningless touchdowns\nin the fourth quarter of every game. And you're going to wind up\nwinning your fantasy matchup that week. So that's again, another example of where\nthe gut is is really to be ignored. Okay. So you just made this game\nreally tough then Mike, because I was hoping then that Elizabeth\ncould represent the data. Right. But you are so in alignment with the data at this point\nthat you just checked your own gut. Well, I mean, I\nmy gut has never gotten me anywhere. I mean, I was there was one year\nI mean the the legendary, on the old show on Mike and Mike,\nwhich I used to host. We had this thing called the KOD,\nI was the Kiss of Death, and it came up because there was one year\nin the playoffs. There were there used to be ten NFL\nplayoff games before the Super Bowl. There are now more\nbecause they've added more wild cards. But in those days\nthere were ten NFL playoff games. And you know,\nwe would make predictions on them. And I went oh and ten against the spread. I defy you to do that on purpose. I defy anyone to go oh and ten against the\nspread through an entire NFL postseason. So if you listen to my gut,\nyou deserve what you get. Well, this conversation has been\njust extraordinary. So thank you, Mike. Thank you, Elizabeth, for sharing your time\nwith us today, for sharing your insights. And everyone\nwho's been listening and watching. Thank you for being here as well. But please stay tuned for the next episode\ncoming very soon. If you've got any thoughts, any comments? If you're upset about your lineup,\ndo this for me. Just light up the comments section,\ndrop them all in the chat. And until then, I'm Albert Lawrence\nand this has been AI in Action. See you soon."
