you're looking for work you've sent in cover letter after cover letter hundreds of applications on every website there is and yet you still have zero responses or maybe worse hundreds of the wrong ones and on the other side employers are having the same problem too few of the right applicants and an avalanche of resumés making the right ones even harder to find it's a bad experience and a bad outcome for all parties nobody's winning and the whole process can end up feeling very impersonal and in human let's figure out how generative AI can help tackle these problems and start to bring the human back into human resources on AI and action in this series we're going to explore what generative AI can and can't do how it actually gets built responsible ways to put it into practice and the real world business problems and solutions that we'll encounter along the way so welcome to AI in action brought to you by IBM I'm Albert Lawrence and today I am joined by John Lester VP of HR technology data and AI at IBM hi John hi elott good to speak to you today good to see you and my other guest is David Levy advisory technology engineer at IBM what's up David hi Albert great look so I know you both are probably wondering why did I Choose You two for today's episode well John is the brains behind IBM's current HR Tech stack and David is a developer turned engineer who at his core is a builder so what better pair to talk with us about how you can use AI for hiring than these two because today I want to talk about HR but HR is a massive field right so let's get specific about it we're talking about applying and interviewing for jobs I think that we can agree that it really is hard out there people all across the globe are having a tough time finding a job and as I mentioned employers can't find the right applicants is there a tech solution for this distinctly human problem I think there's not just one I think there's many and I think if we look at things like Ai and automation that go across the whole end to end hiring pipeline from job wck to attraction to evaluation and finally hopefully offer you're going to try and find the right specific type of AI gen AI automation capability for the right World gotcha so are you also confident about this Tech solution for a human problem David I am yeah and it's necessary we've gotten so far with Automation and Ai and gener of AI now makes so many opportunities to make this process better for the hiring managers and better for the candidates across board okay so I mean that sounds like a potential win for both right the hiring managers as well as the candidates I want to break this down a little bit though I want to dig into the steps that the hiring pipeline can take and how exactly is AI changing those steps within the hiring pipeline when we look at evaluation um this is now that can really offer a lot of value for both employers and candidates but also has the biggest risk attached around ethics similarly as we go across the whole kind of um experience for hiring managers recruiters Talent acquisition practitioners we provided a gen digital assistant capability that guides you through that process gives you prompts gives you insights but also make sure that you kind of stick within the policy and then next step really is to then say how do we do a similar digital assistant that can help candidates through that process because it can be really confusing you don't quite know where to go having that assistant to guide you will completely chains The Experience John I really love the idea of having you know an assistant to help the candidate as an engineer it is a confusing process to get a job and it's a difficult and demoralizing process often and there's so many different things you have to know and routes you have to take in order to get through the hiring process having an assistant that could actually communicate with the candidate that's you know mapped to the data they have on their side maybe like info about the job rooll info about the company all this stuff put into the responses using something you could use like rag uh you know or you could using jbi obviously would be such a huge Boon for candidates and that's across all different Industries I believe you know whenever it really comes down to you to send those applications on out you really can feel alone so that's really encouraging to know that there can be some additional assistance that's really tailored specifically for you there we've done a lot of work with similar things for our employees which is why I think we know this would work because we have a an internal assistant called askhr that people like David use all the time and we just thinking to ourselves wouldn't it be great to take that same experience same automation same drive for productivity back to candidates that we do for employees so we we're pretty confident it should work if the first time you ever interact with a company is the hiring process and you make something that feels good you know it's a comfortable hiring you get hopefully you get the offer everything you're going to start you're going to get right in you're going to be you're going to like the company you're working for because it started off on the right foot and I think that's so huge the beginning the launch is so very important I want to know from you John where is it ethical to use AI in the hiring process I mean that's a brilliant question because a lot of the legislation that's coming out of the EU a lot of legislation that's coming out of the US around how we use AI with the workforce is really kind of touching on the what should AI be used for and what shouldn't it and I think it's worth reminding ourselves that AI is not new I think it's been around many many years but I think what's changed is that gen AI has suddenly moved AI into the public Spotlight at IBM I'm actually really proud of the fact that as an organization we put AI ethics at the heart of everything we do with AI not just HR but across all Enterprise back in 2018 we created an AI ethics board that brings together key principles of ethical Ai and I think certainly yeah I've been at first slightly daunted by this because I've taken a number of our recent Solutions around assistant around orchestration and automation to that board and actually they're there to help you know they're not there to to intimidate intimidate it's really the advice they give us around things like explainability fairness transparency robustness and privacy as well as I think a fundamental key principle that we have to keep humans in the loop with AI as in humans ultimately make decisions about humans what AI does is augment Us in making quicker and more informed ones I see it now as a real a real benefit for me to have that group of people there to to help me keep on the right side of the law but also make sure that we do these things in the way and I think that's something for me I I know massively rely on on all of any your Innovations around Ai and in particular geni so that AI ethics board that you mentioned John is that something that's unique to IBM or other companies also utilizing the same approach there are small number that follow similar approaches um I spend a lot of my time talking to peers in the market kind of sharing our story listening to theirs obviously because we we learn a lot from them I would say to them it's a relatively New Concept to the majority and what we say to them is as you move more and more into Ai and especially gen AI this is this is not a an option you have to bring this in because otherwise you're going to get people like myself out there going should I be doing this will it match with the the latest legislation or not should I stop doing something so for me it's it's not a it's not something that should be optional in any organization it should it should be mandatory for me with that in mind then David like how does that impact how you build I think Engineers have a compulsion to make everything efficient and automated like my compulsion to build something would just be like let's figure out the most efficient way to go through this entire process I wouldn't even think of a human in the loop because it if if I'm thinking as an engineer but if I'm thinking as a candidate that's totally different it makes so much sense to me the way I would think about it I I was thinking about it last night about big part of recruiters issue is that they have a thousand resum and so they have a thousand rumes in the docket and they have to be like who's the best who going to push forward to the next round and there's a way I believe you could you know obviously use NLP to entity extraction and semantic all that stuff you go to machine learning you start scoring but that's where we start getting into like I believe the Muddy Waters with the ethics board once we start scoring these resumés and like obviously J and I could like summarize their resume and all this stuff but John how do how do we solve something like that if we just give suggestions to the recruiter would that pass the sniff test for the ethics board or is it how does that work I mean it's it's interesting because a number of years ago kind of back in 201617 we started experimenting with using kind of um traditional AI to actually start analyzing everybody's CV and as you say score and rank and we felt really uncomfortable about that because it was even though you may still say here's one to 100 a natural human inclination is just say that's so great I've only got to look at top 10 and figure out which ones I interview so we are very much led by a uring mechanism what we do now is we much more go to assessments um that basically tell us does this individual have the Baseline set of skills we need so we almost use it to knock people out who actually don't have the capabilities we do something similar around language capabilities in certain parts of IBM in certain parts of of the world you have to be able to speak English for example so we use assessments to kind of go yes no and what that tends to do is is actually drop quite a decent proportion out then unfortunately it is still down to the recruiter to start going through what's left and go okay these people um are now matching the basic capabilities how do I know start to rank them and figure out which ones I'm going to pass through to interview so even with that it seems like a human is always going to be an essential part of the loop there they have to be it's back to how David said how do I question you know if I get rejected if I know there's been a human in there somewhere at least I know there's been a a human based judgment call if I just think it's an algorithm a I'm going to go well hang another way that doesn't seem particularly Fair what about bias within the algorithm but B how do I then go figuring out how to beat the algorithm because we're all competitive we all want to get our CV to the top of that list and that's where I think some people are starting to think how do I beat these algorithms well don't because we only do algorithms that go yes no answers there is no inference there's no judgment in there and I think when we start talking about inference in hiring that's where we start the ethics board start looking us very closely and say yeah that's not something we want to do so David though like when you are training data how do you try to ensure that bias is being removed on the build side when you look at training data there's a lot of methods to try to totally remove bias and like this the obvious ones right take all demographic descriptors out of all the data use you don't have their name you don't you don't have their race you don't have their age nothing right that's one of the part of cleansing the data but if you try to get your data set you have a really broad set of data and you're using from a truly diverse uh set of people that's one of the best ways to do because you're you have anonymized data cleanse data but also a really wide net of data of a lot of different people a lot of different situation that's one way to deal with it it is a really really tricky thing to to fix because there's bias that you wouldn't say like you wouldn't see it and you'd have to check you'd have to audit your training data after the fact to see if there's any patterns of favoritism for any any type of biases you have to constantly be governing the data that you're using the models that you're using otherwise you will it will just pop up you can't really anticipate what it will be until it's already built and then you're following along you could try your best but I think governance is is that's the way to really really take a deep look into it with any technology we would always test it as much as we possibly could before go live the thing with AI and in particular gen AI is you have to do even more testing once you're live than you you do to get it live in the first place and you never stop testing and that's kind of quite a new thought to people it's almost like we have a model we build we test we do uat testing and then we get live now it's actually getting live is almost like the start of the journey so I think we we had a really interesting one back when we we were kind of experimenting with matching and things like that and we found that for a particular role within IBM the people from a specific University always seem to get to the head of the list and then and then when we looked at it um it was like there's a clear bias in the programming and then we looked at the engineers who' built it and four of them had been to that University so now fair play completely unbiased there was there was definitely no intent but they had build the algorithms based on what they knew to be good what they knew to be good had been taught by that University so and we only found that out by testing after the fact by continuously running the algorithms by Contin looking at the reporting and we caught it and then we were able to fix the problem but then we just sat back and went okay maybe this experimentation is not a good thing and then we again we started s to the ethics board he just said nope any inference any scoring just take it out that's not allowed in the hiring process at all right you know the funny thing about that is though people being concerned that AI might have bias but these are humans that are still we as humans we have our own biases as well too so we're working against that with it there's a lot of um a lot of publicity around that bias within the AI bias human bias that we build into the programs but yet if you were to just have 100% humans do this humans are more biased than some of the algorithms we build so then you get this kind of real challenge that says actually maybe if you put the both of them together you get the best outcome and that's where we're really kind of pushing heavily is where you can automate a response yes no or knock people out because they don't have a a designated skill or experience that's that's no there's no inference there's no uncertainty in there that's really good because that then gives the humans a less number of of candidates to look at less CVS and it can speed the process up it can reduce the time to higher but I think it's that balance between humans and AI that if you perfect it will really take us forward so this workflow that both of you were talking about it seems as though it really all does hinge on data and data preparation because these models are only as good as the data and the continuous preparation that they're actually given so be honest with me here and with the world that's listening do you actually see a world where your resume doesn't just get lost in some black hole once we click Send I do you do yeah I do there's automation processes all this stuff's going to get better and like John let me ask you this like the thought of getting no response first getting an automated response versus getting a personalized automated response like there's all these steps that you could take the worst in my opinion the most demoralizing is getting nothing just it's just a black hole right getting an automated response is not much better because it's just like you could tell it's a caned response sorry you know it didn't work out whatever but having having the automation tools and having gen and having all this holistic data about the candidate about the role about the company maybe even making suggestions for a separate role that maybe they weren't a fit for this one but using this automation process using AI giving them suggestions for another role within the company or or or telling them like these are the things that you were lacking and you could do this with you could you could have a paragraph written so that the uh the hiring manager recruited doesn't have to write anything but they have to just edit it and approve it and send it rather than just having an all automated I think that is a distinct possibility know it's a difficult question like to say which one I would prefer I know the one I would never want is just no response so I I'm hopeful and I do believe it I guess what we're starting to call intelligent orchestration is where you've now got automation that can actually almost like work with you through the whole program and you can train that orchestration to kind of look at events or look at timelines and say this individual sent their CV in on a Monday by Friday has anybody got back to them and the answer is no okay then the orchestration will go back and say thank you for your CV we are considering it we'll get back to you by a certain date and the orchestration can then look and say well has anyone got back by that future date so again we can use the alteration to really track that individual candidates process from from start to finish and constantly either send communication directly but personalized back to the candidate or nudge the hiring manager or the recruiter to say did you not realize this person is still waiting on a response for here and what they can also do is say okay if all the people have replied have we what did the metrics show us that we've actually got back to every one of those candidates with with an outcome the outcome may be sorry you know you're not a good match for this particular role but actually what you consider these others it could be you know what we are in the interviewing process next week and we'd love you to invite you to that process all of that's just data it's data points it's it's a a defined workflow that these this intelligent orchestration can now massively ensure that people don't get forgotten and that you get a timely and personalized response either from the technology or from a human whichever works I I got to tell you this actually I'm excited about this like I I mean look nobody wants to be rejected right like rejection really does hurt but I feel like ghosting is maybe the most hurtful form of rejection where you put all of your work on out there this is something that's very personal and then you just get nothing back at all so just hearing from the both of you you know this idea of not only just an automated response but something that does feel customized towards like my particular skills towards other ways that I still might be able to to join the company but that's me from an applicant perspective right how can a company actually benefit for that so basically like what's in it for a company in order to put this additional effort out there so I think from from my perspective we've got a vision of creating what we call a digital IB this digital ibma is one platform that includes ad hoc tasks using lar language models process automation through AI assistant and even program automation or orchestration all on one platform what that will do is take the the data that we need from from unfortunately still in IBM we've got a lot of HR systems a lot of recruiting systems we are massively simplifying that and that CRA this concept of data fabric but what we do is we have some really key metrics we look at things like time to hire uh look at things like quality of hire but we also look at things like time to productivity and how much productivity can we give back to hiring managers recruiters T acquisition partners and what we've just been talking about that for me is the big benefit is yes as a candidate you're going to get a better experience brilliant but from a employer's perspective all of those key metrics we are seeing gen and AI significantly improve them and managers now have time to actually do what we call high value work high value work in this case is those people that you're really focusing on that you would love to join IBM or any company spend time with them reach out to them talk to them engage them make them feel that you know what I as a person would love you to come and work in my team that's that empathy that's that personalization that we're all striving for but but managers in particular too busy David mentioned it earlier they're too busy to do what they would love to do because they're too busy doing admin the platform we're talking about when dig will take a lot of that had been work away and also even give you prompts and insights as to how you then approach that individual which is going to be brilliant you think like they they would be able to look at the resume look at the job roll look at all this and give suggestions for questions to ask like like like just lead them towards I mean obviously the human in this is the hiring manager she's still there he's still there but they get these suggestions that they might have not thought of that is so that is very cool cuz that would be huge I mean just giving them more time to be like empathetic like just having a personal conversation with the candidate or having and just removing the TDM from their job I think that's I'm very excited so a few takeaways here there are a ton of places in the hiring process that generative AI can help including job specs and job wrecks your very first interaction with an organization is hiring so make this process great it really counts a human in the loop is critical at all touch points so get a solution live but then never stop testing to continue to help preventing bias again I feel very inspired after talking with both of you today I hope that all of our listeners and viewers feel the same exact way I'm so thankful that you both have taken the time to be here so John thank you David thank you this was a fantastic conversation and friends that's it for this episode so we thank you for viewing we thank you for listening but don't worry there's a ton more where this came from and I promise you'll see us here again soon all right [Music]
