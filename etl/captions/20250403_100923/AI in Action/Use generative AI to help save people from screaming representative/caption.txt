representative that's me into a phone trying to talk to a human when I have a customer service issue but instead I'm only getting canned responses so how do we get a human on the line when we really need one or do we need one we're going to get to the bottom of it today on AI in action in this series we explore what generative AI can and can't do how it actually gets built responsible ways to put it into practice and the real world business problems and solutions will encounter along the way so welcome to AI in action brought to you by IBM I'm Albert Lawrence so let's talk about virtual customer service agents and how to actually get help today I'm joined by jeie Walters customer experience speaker trainer and podcast host jeie thanks for being here thank you so much for having me we're gonna have a good time my other guest is Morgan Carroll senior AI engineer at IBM what's up Morgan I am jazzed to be here oh I know you are I feel it now look I know you both are wondering why did I Choose You two for today's episode well it's because you both specialize in the future of customer service and virtual agent experiences big picture I want to explore trust is it time for us to give virtual agents a chance can they really be empathetic personal timely and answer the questions that we actually have I know we're asking for a lot but jeie what do you think I think it's time customers are expecting this they want to be seen and recognized for who they are and where they are on the journey however they interact with Our Brands and so now we have a chance to do that in a way that is automated and personal and all of those things but we have to consider the entire Journey at the same time I think it all comes back to trust we want to make sure that users know that the data that they're giving and receiving is accurate and secure if they are interacting with an artificial intelligence agent versus a human we should let them know that so that they don't think like okay this is aive human no this is artificial intelligence that is assisting us now Morgan you mentioned that it's important for humans to understand when they're speaking with a virtual assistant versus another human jeie why might that be the case can you give me an example we have heard over and over that customers really don't like it and it's not just customers it's all of us right we don't like to be deceived as humans and so it can feel very deceptive when we think we're having this very human conversation and then suddenly it basically says be Boop I can't do it and we realize that it's actually not a human that is breaking trust from the beginning instead of just being open and honest about the fact that you know you're you're talking to a virtual agent who's here to help you people are very open to that well when I am talking with a virtual agent then I guess one of my concerns is that I want to make sure that the answers that I'm given are not just broad generic answers I would prefer for them to actually be answers that pertain specifically to my my questions that address my needs how do you bridge that Gap with generative AI so we're going to connect to different data sources generative AI is going to take all of those different sources and sort of make an experience that is unique to the user without the user having to actually you know press zero go to a live agent have the live agent look at their information but generative AI can do that I think one of the powers of gen AI that we're seeing is that for instance in a contact center if somebody calls in suddenly that agent has the information just like you're talking about Morgan at their fingertips There Are Places still today where agents have to pull out big binders and try to find the information based on the information that they happen to get on the phone call and we're really seeing how we're connecting all that data in the back end to make it easier for the people who serve the customers and customers really are responding to that very positively um you just painted this picture of like humans pulling binders and that feels kind of archaic but I guess it's still happening it's still happening because don't all have the capability to put the data in one place and that's what's so powerful about what gen can do it can connect some of these different systems on the back end so we can actually provide a better front end for the customer okay so I want to get into some of that backend discussion then to now Morgan I'm very curious how do you end up really building that personalized generative AI solution then can you take us through that system yeah so we want to keep the customer in mind first and foremost put ourselves in their shoes and think okay okay how does this conver how should this conversation go that's going to be efficient and get straight to what they need so the first thing we do is sort of build like an outline of a dialogue just like a skeleton like okay this is where we want to start maybe and this is where we want to end and then we're going to come in and add all these different Integrations so maybe a database that has all the customer information so when they call in it's like hi Morgan and you know it's already got all my nobody has to pull out a binder and like search through all this stuff and it just makes it very simple so now that we've had a chance to talk some about the technical and engineering aspect and also really the front faceing customer service aspect how are these two things going to come together yeah so we want to think about the customer experience overall from beginning to end let's say we have someone who they need to get in touch with HR because they're about to go on maternity leave well HR only has five different options to select from and this doesn't fall into any of those categories what do they do obviously we're z00 representative we want to talk to a live person so these are the that we have to consider and this is something that generative AI can help us with okay yeah and I would just say think about the overall kind of strategy and needs of both the brand and organization and the customer that you're serving so for example when when email came out we got very excited about email and we sent all these emails and now we're kind of like we're done with email right and so I think we have to think strategically about how to best serve people and when we're talking about the customer Journey customers want choice you and I might not want to go through the same Journey you might have different needs than I do as far as if I'm in the car I might want to call and talk to a person when that is happening so providing those options for people even though it might be more efficient on our end to use the virtual agent can we give those choices along the way to the customer as well different customers might have different preferences regarding how they would like to be helped uh what are some of those preferences like well I mean think about the different circumstances that we go through in our daily lives I kind of get a chuckle when people say things like well our Digital customer journey is this and you know our in-person journey is this because sometimes we go into a store sometimes we want to shop digitally sometimes we might prefer a virtual agent in a chat and sometimes we might need to talk to somebody and call them right away and we don't necessarily fit into the boxes that they give us so that customer choice of how to be served and helped is just super super important so I'd like to Pivot to the agent experience they're obviously inundated with a number of emails and there's plenty that virtual assistants can automatically respond to but if they have perhaps something more difficult um they're getting a lot of these emails per day and they have to respond to these generative AI can actually assist them it's not going to necessarily respond for them it could but in this case we're thinking about how can we make the customer service agents job easier in gener of AI can help them draft an email or look up information stuff like that so even if a customer isn't speaking directly to a virtual agent generative AI is still playing a role with the human- to human contact exactly but then it makes me think about this idea of being a proactive versus reactive why is that important to the entire process and how might a customer feel and experience that on the front end well when you get right down to it if somebody is contact customer service something has probably gone wrong already so yes we want those moments to be efficient and effective but we also want to prevent those moments from happening because it will reduce cost for the brand and everybody else but it also makes the customer field more valued and cared for so if we can predict for instance Based on data and AI can look for patterns really well so maybe AI notices you know a lot of customers are returning this product after 3 months what's going on and then we can figure out well it's breaking after 3 months that's not great so let's figure out what is actually going on and proactively prevent that from happening or proactively reach out to the customer and say we think this might happen in 3 months here's a proactive solution for you that makes people feel really kind of recognized and seen in a way that when they have to call in when the onus is on the customer to really solve their problem they don't feel valued as much well Morgan I know we've been talking about the customer service experience but how exactly is an engineer helping to transform and to build the customer service experience okay so this is exactly what I do every day um think back back in the day when you would call a customer service line and you only have you know your five options whatever you have to push one two three and that's all you can do now we can actually use generative AI to take what the user is saying so actually I'm going to break it down on a sort of like a technical level we have our um our dialogue flow here right and then we have the user saying like I need help with this particular thing well if it's not sort of hardcoded into our answers we can actually go out call out to a large language model with some of that information and say like hey we need you to provide an answer to this user and just it's directly connected to the virtual assistant so we get that data back and then we just pass it right along to the user and that works most of the time this is why we have guardrails built into our virtual assistants because obviously all of this is really really new and in my experience you know in building these assistants sometimes we do get a wrong answer and we want to make sure that doesn't happen so we have various tools that um basically if a customer asks a question and we're not really really sure that it's correct then we may just say something like I'm sorry I can't help with that and that's where we need a life person well and this is why it all comes back to transparency and building that trust so that we're not presenting something that isn't quite true truthful to the customer they know the entire time that they're dealing with a virtual agent and that you know what sometimes there are places where we need to introduce a human jumping back into the mindset of being a customer right and if I call on into a virtual agent I'm wondering what are some of the common questions that I probably will be asking as a customer that a virtual agent can actually understand and give me valuable information about well I think right now this is probably the best use of virtual agents are these kind of repetitive very standard questions that customers ask so think about when you're at a hotel some of the questions you might have for the front desk where are the pool towels how do I get a wakeup call what do I do about you know these automatic trpes aren't working or whatever and once you start seeing those patterns that's something that a virtual system could handle very very easily a virtual chat that something that maybe is accessible right in the moment then on the flip side of that these big nuance complicated things that we run into as humans sometimes we need humans and we need both that empathy that a human can give and also just understanding you know what this isn't the standard question this is about something that went wrong that doesn't go wrong a lot we have to figure this out the customer is very upset so once we get to that place then we're going to start seeing new patterns and we're going to start realizing different ways that we can maybe update customers you know if they've already talked to a human and said this is going wrong maybe there's an automation through the virtual agent that says hey I'm your virtual agent I just want you to know we're working on this here's what to do next here's when you can expect to hear from us because that's another thing customers want is just that proactive communication of we heard you and we're working on it well I heard you say automatic drapes and now I want for my next hotel room to have those um but but I'm also thinking you know you gave me some great ideas in terms of in the future what are some ways that a virtual agent might be able to help and what are some of the common questions that customer might be calling on in from Morgan do you happen to have any thoughts in terms of some questions that you are anticipating for customers to be calling in for definitely what are your hours what time do you open um what's your phone number what is your address things like that just simple again repetitive tasks but I actually have a good example of one that we do need a human for um and this happened to me yesterday I got to my hotel and there was no electricity so the hotel actually does they do have a virtual assistant in their app but but obviously that's not really going to be useful if there's no electricity so go to the front and that's a really really simple example but these things happen in the future and now you've got me stuck on this hotel situation both of you um do you think that we'll be able to speak to a virtual assistant and just say open up the curtains that's happening in some hotels already they have Smart speakers they have tablets in the room they have all sorts of ways that we can interact and I think the other side of this that maybe we have have to start thinking about as well is how do we take care of those humans now who are dealing with these big complex issues all the time because in some ways these repetitive things they don't take as much empathy they don't take as much brain power and compassion so they're kind of like a little breather between these big complex things I think we really have to think about the world where we get to where we're asking humans to just carry a big heavy lift for every single thing that they do and look for ways to take care of them well let's stay on this train of thought is we're think about this world where humans don't need to do that why can't we do that right now what's holding businesses back from us getting into Genie's ideal future we're kind of already there um we have a concept Called Agent assist so our agents you know again they we don't want them to have to search through the binder they actually may have their own virtual assistant to help them with these complex customer inquiries so you know customer calls in hotel uh my drapes aren't working and the TV is broken and there's no water well I mean a virtual assistant probably could handle that but I think we're going to want a live person so they're like all right let's look up the information we got to call the water company and electrician you know etc etc and they have this virtual agent that can help and hopefully just put me in a new room yeah because at that point the very least wow okay so then that raises another concern for me which is data privacy and sharing so how do you reconcile that right how does data privacy and sharing end up impacting the personalization that can also make a customer feel really valued right so obviously we don't want someone stealing our credit card number but it all comes down to do we trust the model that we're using we have to make sure that we're open and transparent how is this model being trained where is the data where is my data going you know is it secure so let's think of um a client we have client information over here and then we have our virtual assistant up here in the cloud we we're not actually storing the data in the Cloud it is secure in the customer's environment we're only sending and receiving the data that we need in order to have the conversation Flow versus just here's my credit card number let's just send everything over I think we're at the cusp of a really interesting time around this whole conversation around data privacy and protection because for years we've been talking about the fact that you can have a more personalized experience the more data that a brand knows about you that's why we get suggested purchases that's why we are told when hey that product ordered might be running out you might want to order it again that's all data driven but I think now consumers and customers in general are becoming savier about what that means so I want to give them more control I want to see a world where we can have a dashboard where people can say yes you can use my data this way this way and this way and it's all integrated into their experience from the beginning and they have more control and like visibility into how it's being used I like this like I want to sign up for that like right for that future but I I got to imagine imagine though that there must be some sort of like difficulties with scaling to that like are there any difficulties within that and if so what does that look like let's say you have a your virtual assistant and it's running on a server you may maybe let's say for Simplicity sake one copy what if you have let's say 20 people trying to interact at the same time well since it's running in the cloud it can actually handle multiple transactions if we need you know say like suddenly there's an outage like it's an electricity company we've got 500 customers calling since it's in the cloud it can automatically scale so we have more instances of this assistant to handle more people oh well that's fantastic but you know I have to ask what if it goes wrong what can go wrong oh so many things um tornadoes being from Texas what if a tornado comes through and takes out our data center well that's why we have multiple data centers we're going to have all of our data backed up redundancy in various places so what I'm getting now is you both shared so much today but for my brain I'm trying to process them so I've got a few key takeaways that I'm going to take a stab at okay um keep customers in mind as you start your build because this is customer service after all it's important for humans to feel valued and seen in their requests even if it's not another human that you're speaking with on the other end and we don't like to be deceived so be transparent with your customers if it's a virtual agent it's okay just let me know I'm talking with the virtual agent is that good that's awesome awesome I love positive validation um jeie Morgan thank you so much for being here today you've got rain cells all percolating right now um this is a fantastic conversation that's it for this episode so thank you all so much for listening thank you for watching but worry not there are a ton more great things where this came from and we will see you here again soon [Music]
