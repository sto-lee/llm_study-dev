discussing uh I thought we'd start with some simple use cases and a methodology and then talk to where this might go over time as we develop new business models so let's start simple uh a lot of times when I do talk to clients uh and I'll introduce the methodology next the they start to jump immediately to some of the more complex situations and really that's not what's you're going to do you're going to start with some simple scenarios so let's introduce the methodology and then we'll show some simple uh use cases that you can start with in your industry so from a methodology perspective I have thought of six categories of uh areas that I think about when I'm thinking about what apis might be uh applicable to your particular industry three are on this slide three are on the next the first one uh is mobile or internal development almost all companies start with that and if you think about what you're going to do with your mobile app uh there are three types of information that you might make available the first is generic information so this is common information that anyone who's using your mobile app would get the same answers uh things like where you located uh what are your interest rates if you're a bank what kind of accounts do you have if you're a retailer what kind of products do you have things like that it's the same list for everybody uh the next category would be things like uh uh that are specific to to an individual customer so what is your account balance is going to be different for each individual and finally we might look at uh how uh the mobile device itself can be taken advantage of in conjunction with the apis so things like your GPS coordinates or the camera could be used in conjunction with the apis to provide a good solution second category is partnering uh and we think uh first about the partners that we already have and what kinds of information we're sharing with the partners already and then one of the big areas of API uh growth is in partner on boarding so if you think about what goes into bringing a partner on board today for every partner that you work with you uh after you agree that you will be partners you'll start to um uh introduce your AP your interfaces to them it might be a web service interface before you're using apis and that could be rather complex and you need to set up the security around that for that individual partner uh teach them how to use the uh the the soap interface for the web service and get them all set up and that takes effort on your part and on the part of the partner and when you're done you have one partner on board what we'd like to do with apis is make the uh API self uh sufficient so that the partner can come to the developer portal find the apis sign on and consume those apis without any effort on your part and very little learning on their side you've already done the setup for the security and the testing and so on so it should work very well the third category is public uh and here we start to think think about comparison apps whether uh other parts of the industry may be doing comparisons between what you offer and your competition uh it could also be things that you might make available through others uh that are what I call the industry next door so uh we'll get into that a little bit more uh when I show the examples but other industries that might send customers to you the next category is social obviously there's a lot going on in social media today and we want to take advantage of that and so we start to think about uh things that might be as simple as direct references to your company uh whether positive or negative or other things that people are talking about on social media that you can take advantage of and so those will be some of the things that we'll think about there from a device perspective we'll talk about uh what devices might be taken advantage of and how those devices can work uh with your company and and provide information to you or get information from you to deal with uh the client directly the other thing which I mentioned not that it's going to be a direct uh uh seller for why you'll use apis but if you think about what we've done with the user interface technology over decades every time we come out with a new user interface whether that was the web or now mobile and whatever's going to happen after this we always have to go back to those backend systems and tell the folks okay now you need to support the web now you need to support mobile well once we have apis making the data available uh without context of an individual user interface whatever the next interface is going to be after mobile or tablets that could be glasses it could be um you know something that projects on a screen whatever it may be I don't have to go back to the backend people because we're already making that information available through the API and then the final category and probably one of the most important is valuable data every company is collecting valuable data on your clients about your what your business is doing and a certain subset of the population inside the company is getting access to that data through API eyes we can make that data available to a larger audience inside your company and get more value out of the data we're already collecting finally we might also have a monetization opportunity to sell that data to third parties and make some additional Revenue so let's get into some of the examples so and I said we're going to start simple right so we're not going to think of complicated things when we think about the mobile internal development examples in this case are the account types that a bank might offer the product list that a retailer might have what kind of insurance plans or telecommunications plans often on your website you have prices and really a good way to think about this is what are you doing on your website today those are the kind of things you're probably going to want to do on your mobile app and so those are examples of of basic generic information and then when we think about the customer specific information it might be that they're going to place an order with you and what is the order status or what's their account balance in the bank and do they want to transfer funds all these things have to do uh with individual customers and we need to qualify who they are are and secure that and make sure that they're only seeing their information so all the industries will have things about that as well and then finally using the mobile device itself in conjunction with the apis we might find the nearest ATM right so to do that I need to know where you are and so your GPS coordinates from the phone can help with that or where's the nearest Branch or store or whatever you're looking for if this is an insurance situation maybe we're going to submit a picture uh of a car accident as part of the claim or deposit a check and of course Mobile Wallet for payments is is another big area partnering uh so think about the kind of information we're sharing with Partners already what is the inventory status do I need to reorder the uh additional additional Goods in the commercial banking area we think about the uh large companies that we're supporting as partners and so what we want to do is make available the apis so that the commercial uh so that the banking customers can integrate the apis directly with the bank and make this part of their business processes and that really solidifies the relationship between the bank and and the that particular company part suppliers might make available apis so that people can order from them and repair uh places can make available uh manuals or or you know the ability to uh uh request or repair for something that they have going on in the automotive space options and add-ons and having that be interoperable across multiple different vendors is important and making uh apis available for that that purpose is is a common thing that people will do and then in the government space things like um sharing information across agencies so they are your partner agencies and they need a certain subset of the information inside your Enterprise but not everything and we can make that available on a case-by casee basis through apis and then think about smarter cities and if there's a a situation that occurs and we want to coordinate Emergency Services coming to uh a particular situation and I'll talk more about that when I get to some of the Advan scenarios and then finally platform services are there things that your company does that maybe others can take advantage of billing hosting accounting things like that where other companies can come into you and take advantage of this even having nothing to do with the industry that you're in uh the next category is public and and so here we're talking about the comparison apps so if you want to be involved in a comparison if you're not going to want to be involved in the comparison then nobody's going to buy from you because if they're using the comparison app you're not there so you'll probably want to be a part of that and making apis available that show your products your pricing and the availability can help people buy from you and then finally that industry next door that I mentioned and this is key uh when we start to think about reaching new markets reaching new customers and getting new uh new customers for our particular company think about what other Industries people are dealing with that need what you provide so if you're a bank people who are buying a car need a car loan people who are needing a buying a home need a mortgage or people that are planning for retirement need financial information so what are the other things that people do that need Banking and those are the industries that you want to Target for your apis and make them available for government think about job placement and education and there's many many more uh Health and Fitness for insurance or Healthcare and finally for retail and travel uh vacation uh birthday and holiday uh industry might uh send customers to you for social and Big Data obviously if a if uh someone mentions your company directly on social media they might be saying something positive about your company and you want to capture that and retweet it uh get that information out there if they're saying something negative about your company you want to address that immediately before the word spreads and things get out of hand so uh social interactions are are very big in fact social uh apis are the most common way that people interact with social media it's not a web interface or a mobile uh interface it's through uh through apis uh opportunity identification you might notice that some people are talking about particular things on social media so there's certain keywords that you can key on maybe somebody's talking about going on vacation and you're a retailer and you can sell them something uh in that area or maybe you're a travel uh company that can help them find the a rental car or a hotel in in the area that they're going to and then participating in interest groups as well is something that you can do to uh have a presence and get your advertising out there and also just pop populating social media with with what you're doing as a company and getting involved uh one of the things I've heard about is insurance companies getting involved in this way uh because so much of dealing with insurance companies is always in a negative situation when you're either paying them or you have a claim they want to get out there and and show you that they're doing good things for the uh Community as well device integration think about the devices it's not always obvious uh that you know something is a device not everything is a monitor or a sensor or or something like that cameras can be devices apply liances or devices ATMs cars um there are many things that are devices and uh we can share information from the device back into the Enterprise and take action on that or send commands out to the device like if it's a camera to uh to pan in a particular direction or focus in on something and so uh so those are all things that we can do as well uh I'll come up with a scenario that in the more advanced section on ATMs that will show you some of the kind of futuristic things that we might do in this space as well and then that valuable data category so we're going to get access to this data for a larger audience inside the Enterprise that has tremendous value and you can also then sell aggregated data on clients to third parties and and make that available or if clients opt into marketing you might sell specific information on them to third parties if they choose to to opt in to be marketed to um the other thing I've I've talked to some companies about whether it's a connected car a telecommunications company as people are driving around around the city their route to work can be uh detected and you might sell that uh in aggregate to third parties for marketing to particular audiences and then finally in the government space there's a lot of open data initiatives uh that require uh access to data and apis are a very good way to do that as well so that's that's where we are most companies are going to start with that uh and and I really encourage you to to start simple uh don't don't think of uh immediately of doing the more complicated things uh we'll get there over time but I do want to show you where we can go over time so I've got a couple of scenarios and these are going to be more ecosystem type scenarios things that will involve multiple Industries working together so these are scenario based and and uh I'll just call out a couple of examples here so let's say we have a connected car and it's been in an accident and the airbags have been deployed and there's some possible need for some assistance here um if it's a very severe accident the car might be able to know that and immediately call for accident if it's not sure maybe alert is raised to the driver's mobile phone uh and they can either say yes they need help or if they don't reply that might be an indication that they need help as well and a call can be put out to Emergency Services uh that could be an ambulance it could be fire police the car sensors might determine which ones of those are required um and if there's a fire concern calling the fire department as well the insurance data could be collected probably not the most important thing to to deliver right away but we can certainly collect that and make that available through an API later and then all the things that are going on around that accident so an alert can be issued so that other cars uh can understand that an accident has occurred at a particular place the traffic apps that they're using can be made aware of this accident and can assess what impact that's having on the traffic and whether or not they need to move around on a different route uh hospitals may be notified that uh there's certain injuries that might be coming in and if there's damage to the infrastructure a case can be open so you see here this is not just one industry involved these apis are going to be talking to uh to many different Industries government Health Care insurance uh Auto uh apps social media all kinds of things can happen uh based on one particular scenario and so it's not going to be just one party that's interested but a whole ecosystem supporting uh the help that needs to be given to a particular person that's been in an accident next scenario um a computer computer is going home from work at the end of the day they're going by train they get to the train station and they see that their train is running 10 minutes late um they uh are a a banking customer and that bank happens to have an ATM at the station and they have uh opted in to being marketed to for selected products that they're that that they like and so they have nearfield communication on on their phone and the ATM recognizes that they're in the area and it starts to put together some opportunity to Market to this particular person so the weather apis might be used to determine that it's an extremely hot day and this person's train is running 10 minutes late so what we're going to do is push an advertisement uh uh to that um customer of the bank uh for their favorite ice cream that's on sale uh at a retailer there at the train station and we're going to give them a 10% discount if they buy in the next 10 minutes which happens to be the delay of the train right so all this goes together we then uh push that advertisement to the to the customer the customer goes into the retailer shows the advertisement on their phone and the retailer will make money the consumer package goods company that's selling the ice cream will make more money and the bank will get compensated for part of the transaction for identifying the customer and getting that customer to come into the store so again an ecosystem kind of relationship between Banks retails consumer package Goods uh all working together with weather apis involved as well last example a huge winter storm is is predicted uh and weather apis are tracking the the s it of the storm and the path of the storm and interested parties who are trying to figure out how they're going to get home at the end of their day are starting to get notified that this storm is coming in and so the information from the weather apis is put together with their profile information uh that uh will tell them um you know that knows what their typical work hours are what their route home is and what the path of the storm is through the weather apis and plan what possible actions they might take whether that's leaving early or taking a different route and so on so the individuals can choose to act and and leave work uh status updates can be communicated directly to them through their mobile phone or better yet through their connected car so that they're not dealing with their mobile while they're driving in the storm um and then alternate routing can happen to take place if necessary so that they can get uh to where they're trying to go uh if there are road closures uh things like that because of maybe the travel accident scenario that we talked before they would get notified and uh be able to move around that uh in a more smooth fashion and then in addition we can start pushing the status updates out to social media so that others can see what's going on uh with the road conditions and the road clearing estimates so these three examples are just examples of multiple Industries working together uh in an ecosystem and where this API economy is going to go over time these are not the first scenarios that you're going to work on as a company so start with those simple scenarios and and work forward from there I've written lots of blogs uh on on this topic best place to start uh is on uh the URL at the top of this page this is an A A Blog that I've written on API use cases for every industry and if you start here you get some good recommendations that apply across Industries including the idea of looking at what other Industries are doing uh that blog will link to 20 different industry specific blogs that I've written with the use cases in the six categories that I mentioned earlier so you can get some sample use cases in your specific industry for uh for what you might do to start off with and maybe some Advanced uh scenarios as well so this is uh again a very hot topic one of the things that businesses really need to think about as they start to move into the API economy and hopefully these blogs and this video will help you uh move forward successfully"
