endpoints like phones laptops and servers are the first line of defense for security teams today but with so many overlapping tools on the market where should you start let's take a look at the differences between the main three product categories that firms are turning to EDR Epp and ngav let's start with Next Generation antivirus or rather just antivirus because traditional AV Solutions work through signature based detection so they identify and block known threats by comparing the fingerprint of a file to a database of known malicious ones Next Generation antivirus improves on this by using Ai and behavioral analysis to block both known threats and unknown threats including zero day attacks and more sophisticated malware that may evade signature-based detection however the scope of these Solutions is limited to prevention and they don't necessarily give security teams the rich Telemetry needed to address the rapidly evolving threat landscape so now let's look at endpoint protection platforms these primarily focus on preventing known threats using a combination of signature-based detection heuristics and behavioral analysis while they can be effective against many common threats they can struggle to detect new and sophisticated attacks and due to this in my experience teams rely on Epps to perform the basic I.T hygiene and maintenance tasks like enforcing policies that ban USB access patching applications and launching scripts to perform tasks at boot time finally let's look at endpoint detection and response because EDR goes beyond prevention by being proactive supporting continuous monitoring and real-time threat detection plus incident response EDR tools are often better at serving security teams useful intelligence by collecting and analyzing large volumes of telemetry across the total endpoint landscape EDR can help identify patterns and anomalies on mass that can indicate the presence of threats even apt's zero days or end-day attacks plus it allows organizations to perform threat hunting activities to proactively defend against new threats ibms can even learn from previous threats and the remediation actions your security teams took to better respond to similar threats in the future okay so which one is the best for your organization there's no one-size-fits-all answer and it'll really depend heavily on what you're trying to achieve you should consider the sources of risk that you're exposed to the size of your it environment any applicable regulatory requirements and the resources that you have available to manage optimize and make these tools effective however at the very least you should be able to detect and respond to both known and unknown threats and be able to proactively search for the presence of indicators of compromise across all of your endpoints and it's for this reason that many organizations are adopting EDR Solutions or Outsourcing it to a trusted partner with MDR or considering xdr to address further Automation and specific use cases to find out more about IBM's EDR solution click the links in the description and subscribe to see more security videos from IBM
