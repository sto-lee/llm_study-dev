  "caption": "have you ever noticed that in almost every action-packed movie a bad guy is able to break in and steal a Priceless piece of art or some expensive diamond by finding that one security camera blind spot well the same thing happens in the cyber world hackers are trying to break in by finding that one blind spot that one vulnerability or weak link that can they can take advantage of the good guys the security analysts are left fighting an uphill battle and they are experiencing burnout they are dealing with disconnected tools sometimes hundreds of tools that are not communicating with each other so they're going back and forth checking all these different tools which by the way create hundreds if not thousands of alerts daily so what's a security analyst to do enter Sim it's one tool that outputs High Fidelity alerts and we'll get back to this in a second so what's a Sim a Sim basically is a tool that pulls in sources from a whole bunch of different places it Aggregates the data it consolidates it and it sorts it to identify threats it's the core threat protection technology that most organizations use on their war against hackers so let's talk about what you can input into your sim so you can have um logs you can put in your threat Intel you can put in your vulnerability feeds you can put in your network detection and response data and data from your endpoint um and response tools so all of this is going to be integrated into your sim and this is where the magic happens so your sim is infused with AI machine learning and Analytics and it's going to correlate all the different data from here in real time so that it outputs a high fidelity alert and they're going to be prioritized by severity so you know which one needs immediate attention so what does high fidelity mean High Fidelity High Fidelity is just a fancy way of saying you're going to get a better alert so let's talk about the spy movie again say for instance a bad guy is breaking into a museum to steal a piece of work and they cause a distraction in the front of the museum but they're really breaking in the back door so the false positive that the Sim is weeding out is the distraction in the front of the museum and the breaking in in the back is the high fidelity alert so let me leave this with you regardless of your organization's size threats are on the rise the bad guys are not discriminating and they're using highly sophisticated Technologies and techniques to exploit vulnerabilities across networks applications systems and storage devices simply put a SIM is a good guy's secret weapon so I hope this is giving you a clear understanding of what SIM is and why it's important thank you if you like this video and want to see more like it please like And subscribe if you have questions please drop them in the comments below"
