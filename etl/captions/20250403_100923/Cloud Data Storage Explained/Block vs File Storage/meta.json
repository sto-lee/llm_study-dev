this is a pretty intro intro and basic level question i'm glad you guys came to learn the difference because when you're talking about cloud computing these are far and away the two most commonly used kinds of storage and so to start off we're going to get our block over here and then we're going to put our file over here and let's talk about the difference between these two because this difference is really important there are two different kinds of storage the way that they present is different the underlying technology is is different but most importantly they have specific uses that make them very very distinct so let's start over here with block let's get into that one first so if we think about block storage on the underlying layer if we think about the physical devices that the data is stored on when you write out to a block volume you're going to write a file out that file is going to get broken up into lots of independent parts and each of those independent parts is going to go onto that storage device now what makes block really useful as a storage media is each of these different parts can be moved around for efficiency's sake so you can move them around on a single disk you can move them around on a raise of disk or in the case of cloud storage where we have entire clusters of physical hardware you can move these things around to wherever they need to be that's the block part now when it comes time to mount this block device to your virtual machine that's where things get really interesting right so over here i've got my vsi my virtual server and to my vsi i want to attach storage right i have to have something to run my operating system off of i have to have storage to store the data that is being processed i have to have storage in order to store my backups and so a blocked device can actually be mounted to this virtual server in two different ways the first is it can be mounted directly via a mount point m and t so via mount point so when you order a block device you're gonna get a little mount point that goes along with it it can be mounted to your virtual server using windows or linux whatever your preference is you just put in the address that proper security information and you can mount it and then you can start using it have to apply file system obviously but away you go in addition to that during the provisioning process so when this virtual server is being provisioned we can have a block device that gets mounted up here into the hypervisor layer and it acts looks and feels just like it was a physical disk that's mounted into the machine now big difference here if you're talking about a block device that is mounted directly to the virtual server you can unmount it and mount it to another virtual server over here so let's say that all right i've written a bunch of data out to it and i don't want it attached to that one anymore i'm going to spin up a second vsi i'm going to put an x over that bad boy and i'm now going to mount it to my new virtual server let that new virtual server work on all of the data that's in there let me give you another use case for it let's imagine that i have a virtual server that is doing a bunch of processing information and it's writing that out so let's put that bad boy over here vsi and i have a block device that is mounted to it and so my virtual server here it's doing lots of processing right it's preparing data sets data analytics maybe but it is only doing all of the processing it's not actually serving that data out to anybody else let's say that i have four more vsis that are over here that those are the ones that are going to serve this data out and so what they can do is each of them can mount this block device but mount it read only and so when you've mounted this thing read only you don't have to worry about data corruption or anything like that because all they can do is read from it but they can get access to it in real time and so they can bring down the latest information so block device probably the most commonly used storage in cloud now let's talk for a minute about file file storage um is the other most commonly used storage and the big difference between file and block so remember i said block whenever we write out we write out in all these little bits right there's some metadata that goes along with them but not just a ton mainly it's the job of the operating system in that virtual server to provide you all of the other information file stores on the other hand or a file share maintains the directory hierarchy in the same way that you think about it in displayed at the operating system layer so if i have an a file share here inside that file share i'm going to have folders and inside those folders i'm going to have files just like if i was looking at any other kind of a storage device on a local machine but it is native to this actual storage media itself the media maintains this logical hierarchy and maintains the metadata that goes along with that hierarchy so whenever i mount an nfs share i can do interesting things like collaboration remember over here in order to maintain file integrity we had to lock the entire volume and make it read only well file is not quite that inflexible file you have the ability because you have all of the metadata in it and you're maintaining that hierarchy you can lock individual files within a file share so over here in that example so now let's get our vsi and we are going to mount a file share and we're going to call this one mntf for file now let's imagine that i have a bunch of laptops right so my my users have a network share in the office that they use and so i've got no i don't know two different laptops right and each of these laptops is accessing files that are stored on this central directory so laptop one can go out and access it read it make changes whatever it's locked only while it's being written to laptop two can do the same thing you know it's locked only while it's being written too now you always run into the issue of potential data integrity errors in that you'll get out of sync right so what what one machine is seeing may not be synced up with what another machine is thinking but you probably won't corrupt and kill the file the way you would have five or ten years ago now another place that file storage is kind of nifty is it can be performance adjusted to be pretty fast and so if you're talking about storing a structured backup file so rather than just a single backup file that has the integrity within it maybe you've got a bunch of backup files that you know that you need to maintain in a specific series of folders in order for your rewrite to happen correctly or your restore to happen correctly that is going to be better stored in file storage than it is in block storage because again with file you're just going to take you're going to mount it to your virtual server and then your backup software can pick up that logical hierarchy and start your restoration so file storage block storage both are mounted at the operating machine level at the virtual server level at the os level uh the big difference there is remember block can also be mounted up at the hypervisor level file storage cannot you cannot boot from a file share right file is purely for storing whereas block is both bootable and used for file storage itself so that's the big difference between the two let's talk about practical applications block storage you can boot from it right your operating system can run on it a database you're always going to want to put a traditional database and a relational database into block storage you do not want to store that on file storage you're going to have all kinds of issues and you try and do that because the inherent chunking ability of that block storage is going to make it much easier to tweak and get higher performance out of so these block volumes obviously you can adjust the performance every cloud provider is going to give you the ability to have low performing medium performing high performing ultra high performing but they're going to adjust your ability to do to have as much performance as you need file storage again same idea you can adjust the amount of performance that you need but you can't dial the knobs quite as neatly as you can on the block side so again block you're going to put your databases on there operating system boot images um data that is right once read many times it's going to go great there file file is great for mounting to many devices right 16 32 50 or 100 devices at once it maintains that hierarchy so it's really useful for traditional shares and when it comes to access control you know it can inherit user directory permissions and things like that so that certain users are only authorized to see certain folders within the within the construct other places that you might use file um oh let's see you could use file storage for documents you can use it for videos you can use it for collaboration uh let's imagine cad files all right so computer aided design files you're an architect or you're some sort of a machine designer you're an engineer you're working on these big huge cad documents you're going to want to store those cad files into a file share that way you can share that out because you again just like our example down here you've got many users that need to access it and make changes and most cad software is pretty clever now and so you don't have to worry about running into data conflicts as you're doing that so that's an overview of block versus file it's why you would use one versus the other they're both incredibly important in the world of cloud and hopefully you found it
