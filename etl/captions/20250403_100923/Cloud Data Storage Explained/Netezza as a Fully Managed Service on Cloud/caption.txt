welcome back folks my name is love agarwal with ibm today i'm excited to share with you netiza as a fully managed service on cloud so let me start with what netezza users already know and what has always made it the enterprise data warehouse of choice things like speed simplicity and agility the community loves these aspects about natisa and while we have doubled down on them to make them better users also wanted to see a few new things to help them modernize their data strategy and bring data warehousing into the age of cloud users asked for a fully managed price performance offering that provides them with on-demand elastic scaling and consumption-based billing on public clouds we listened to this feedback and incorporated it into netezza as a fully managed service on cloud this massively parallel processing high performance cloud data warehouse runs the next generation neteza database engine this means users can now enjoy the same hardened and performant netize engine they trust to run their critical workloads on and combine it with the benefits of a cloud native solution so let's talk about what's new simplicity as a fully managed cloud native offering netizza as a service abstracts away the complexities of optimizing the underlying resources including cpu disk and network infrastructure users really only need two units these being how fast you want to go and how much data you need everything else is fully abstracted and managed by us load and go with no tuning and no indexing existing netiza customers enjoy risk-free and frictionless upgrades with a single command granular elastic scaling we have brought incredibly granular elastic scaling capabilities to the platform this allows you to apply computational power only when you need it users select the performance characteristics that meet their workload requirements and can increase or decrease performance as workload demand ebbs and flows you also have the ability to pause and resume resources as needed as well as auto pause to scale down when the platform is idle storage density can be increased independently of performance demands as capacity needs require this is opposed to other offerings that scale exponentially with fixed t-shirt sizes leading to over provisioning of resources and unanticipated costs our unique approach gives you linear performance scaling and cost predictability in the cloud you only pay for what you need and when you need it speed netezza as a service is designed specifically for running complex analytics on very large data volumes it's unique massively parallel processing architecture combined with hybrid columnar acceleration assist delivers blistering fast query performance on highly complex mixed analytical workloads sophistication this one is all about operationalizing data science and machine learning at scale netezza brings analytics to the data its rich 200 plus built-in analytics capabilities support all major languages such as python r java and more data scientists and analyst teams can build models that operate on data predict and score directly inside the database instead of having to offload it to a separate environment and deal with the associated pre-processing and transformations for users ready to move from their netezza appliances to the manage as a service offering it could not be easier upgrade risk free to netize as a service with a single command start enjoying granular elastic scaling superior price performance and cost predictability in the cloud with a sophisticated cloud data warehouse that provides best-in-class analytics capabilities to drive your business goals talk to your ibm representative today to take netize as a service for a test drive and check out the links below to learn more about our offering you
