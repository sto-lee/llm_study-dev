hi there and thanks so much for joining us today my name is bradley knapp and i'm with ibm and we're answering your basic intro to computing questions and basic questions about cloud computing and the question that i'm here to talk with you about today is one that we get on a pretty regular basis from young companies startup companies college students and folks like that and it's we see all the time about vmware what is vmware and so this is a topic that is one that guest asks a lot right it's one that we spent a lot of time talking about vmware is a software company headquartered out in palo alto california that has software that allows for virtualization of almost every function of computing into what they describe as a software defined data center now that is a million different buzzwords don't worry about it we're going to get into the details but the important thing to understand is vmware is a standalone company they're publicly traded they sell their software this is not free and open source it's available for sale and it is enterprise grade it is designed for enterprise grade virtualization if you're not sure about virtualization or the components of that please check out the other videos on the channel but with that let's jump right in here so imagine if you will you are a company and you have a large pool of physical servers compute resources sitting in a data center and you want to get more efficient use out of them well the way to do that is to virtualize them carve them up into smaller pieces and then use those pieces to run whatever workload you need so starting off our stack here we're going to have our physical servers and i'm just going to make oh i don't know six of them right do a little s in here s s s s this is physical hardware right and so we've said all right we want to be more efficient with that physical hardware so now this is when we start installing the vmware software the first three pieces and these are the most important ones are going to be the three layers that sit on top that virtualize our is solutions right so that first piece is going to be virtualizing the compute piece this used to be called esxi and now it's called vsphere right so vsphere is what is going to virtualize the compute the compute piece next as we move up the stack is the storage piece so storage how are we going to virtualize that storage layer well we're going to use software called vsan and then the third piece of our isp pyramid right is going to be network how do we virtualize network well you virtualize network with the vmware product called nsx so using these three things together we have a pool of compute resources and we're going to be able to divide that pool up into virtual servers or virtual instances this is our software defined data center right compute storage network and so we are then going to be able to provision virtual servers and these virtual servers are only pieces of some of the underlying physical machines and inside this virtual server right you've got your operating system and then on top of it you've got your application stack well what if you're not doing a virtual server based environment what if this vmware cluster is going to be used for containers same general idea right so in that case you're going to have your container kernel right your linux kernel and then on top of that container kernel you're going to have your millions of little containers that you're creating and destroying and creating and destroying and creating and destroying so on and so forth and then the piece that i haven't talked about yet and this is maybe some of vmware's best sauce their magic sauce is how do you control all this stuff and so that is why running across the side here we have v center vcenter is the control software that controls all of these things it's got a wonderful little web portal you can log into it create and destroy create and destroy as much as you want now this software defined data center this is the infrastructure level component and while it is incredibly important this is 2021 this is the modern world and we can't just have this in the abstract we need more and so let's talk a little bit over here about what's called the v realize suite v realize is a bunch of different solutions that make running the cloud piece over here the infrastructure piece over here much simpler so let's see here v-r-e-a-l-i-z-e so v realize the two pieces that get talked about the most often are going to be vra and vro that's v realize automation and v realize orchestration or vla vrealize operations depending on who you ask so you've got your vra and your v r o the automation piece is about automatically standing up and standing down virtual servers about automatically standing up and standing down containers automatically doing load balancing automatically shifting virtual servers from one physical host to another because they need to resize it automatic resizing and so on and so forth it is your automation engine vro if you realize operations is all of the other components that are not operating i'm sorry that are not automating but aren't monitoring and operating right you've got lots of nifty little software tidbits in here to keep track of your infrastructure environment in real time other components that live within this vrealize world you've got oh monitoring you've got logging you've got security components and then you've got analytics and analytics visualization engine again this is the software stack that you need in order to run the physical hardware in virtual hardware that at the end forms the core of those enterprise workloads so hopefully you've learned a little bit about what vmware is if you'd like to learn even more of course anybody at ibm would be happy to talk with you about it you can obviously reach out to us in the comments or get in touch with your ibm team directly and we'll be happy to say how can we work with you to integrate vmware to make your world better
