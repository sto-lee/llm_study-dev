Now, I know in previous videos we talked about\ntechnical concepts that always relate back to cloud-native computing in one way or another. Now, over the years I've seen businesses harness\nthose concepts to create innovative solutions to real problems. In this era of Hybrid and Multicloud businesses\nneed a way to run containerized applications in a way that they can run anywhere. In this video I want to touch on a few of\nthose use cases for why a business may want to use Hybrid or Multicloud. Let's start with the basic one, Cloud Scaling. Now, most of us are probably familiar with\nthis, it is one of the main reasons for adopting the cloud. Now, let's say we have a flower delivery service\nthat is able to hit a certain bottom line of users. They have on-premise infrastructure\nand it can hit a certain amount of user load. So, visualizing this here throughout the calendar\nyear you can imagine that their load maybe goes up and down in response to specific holidays. Now, to hit those peaks they could scale up\ntheir on-premise architecture but that's met with upfront costs and cost of upkeep. Now, instead we'll take advantage of cloud\nthat allows them to scale up in response to that load and then automatically key provision\nresources when they no longer need them. Now, this concept is kind of general to cloud\ncomputing not just Hybrid or Multicloud, but that brings me to my next topic and here we're\ngoing to be talking about how it can be used to build a Composite Cloud. So, essentially this is going to be applications\nthat are spread across multiple cloud environments. So, back to the flower delivery service let's\nsay they have an on-premise architecture that allows them to run three major components\nof the app. So, let's say they have the web UI, they have\nsome billing API's, as well as a rewards framework. Now, let's say that this service is actually\nbased in the EU. And their European customers are happy but\nfor their North American, or American customers, specifically around Veterans Day or Thanksgiving\ntheir noticing that the system is bogging down and so they decide to take advantage\nof a Hybrid Cloud or Multicloud architecture by composing their application across multiple\ncloud environments. So, they'll take advantage of data centers\nin America and essentially they've identified that although their rewards framework can\nstay on-prem in their European side they want to move the billing and the U. I. capabilities\nover. So, they'll move just those two to a cloud platform of their choice in a North\nAmerican, or American datacenter. This kind of allows them to scale up portions in response\nto say American holidays while keeping their EU portions individually scaled. So, in this\nexample the flower delivery service is able to take advantage of scaling at a global level\nby using the Hybrid or Multicloud architecture. Next let's talk about the airline or travel\nindustry. So, we can first start with an example of\nModernization. Now, in the past we've seen that reservation\nsystems may have been difficult to work with or you might have had to call in, but almost\nall the airline companies now have a mobile application. So, most of the time of actually\nfound that it's about in general not just in the travel industry but eighty percent\nof all enterprise applications are actually still on-prem. This likely the case in this\nindustry as well. So, in this specific example, let's say they\nhave a reservation system that's running on-premises, but to create new experiences for their end\nusers, let's say they've created a mobile application. That mobile app of course has\na mobile backend that's maybe running in a public cloud and that in turn works with the\nreservation service. So again, the mobile app can hit the mobile backend that in turn\nworks with the reservation capabilities. So, in this case they modernized and new user\nexperiences are possible, but let's take that a step further. Now, a source for a lot of\ndissatisfaction for users is whenever their flights are delayed. So, when a flight is\ndelayed, they may have to re-book new flights. The solution is almost always the same, the\ntraveler wants to get to his destination in the easiest way possible. So, what airline industries have been doing\nis taking advantage of the cloud to create maybe a recommendation feature. So, it allows them to book new flights as\nsoon as the delay is recommended or as soon as the delay has ocurred and that's going\nto connect up to the mobile back in service allowing users to be able to book flights\nthrough their phone the second the flight is delayed. This not only improves the bottom\nline for the airline industry but leads to happier users. So, that's one way that modernization\nhas been done. Next, let's take it even a step further and\ntalk about Data and AI. For Data and AI, the airline industry has\nbeen taking advantage of lots of historical data. So, over the decades that a company\nhas been around, let's say they have historical data of when unplanned maintenance has happened\non their airline. In fact, thirty percent of all delay time\nin that in the airline industry is actually when unplanned maintenance happens. So, by taking advantage of let's say machine\nlearning or AI capabilities, they could hook into all of the legacy data that they have,\nlarge volumes and connect them up to machine learning and AI capabilities. This allows airline industries to take advantage\nof predictive analytics and get insights before errors, or before that unplanned maintenance\never occurs. This again improves their bottom line, leading to happier users and a more\nefficient airline industry. Now, today we talked about four major use\ncases for Hybrid and Multicloud platforms. So, Cloud Scaling and Composite Cloud in the\nflower delivery service, as well as Modernize and Data and AI for the airline industry. Now, we really have only started to scratch\nthe surface of the number of use cases for why you want to use a Hybrid or Multicloud\nplatform.
