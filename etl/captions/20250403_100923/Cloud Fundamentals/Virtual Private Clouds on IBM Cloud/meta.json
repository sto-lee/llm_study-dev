Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, allows the user of the cloud environment to define Virtual Private Networks, manipulate them, control them,\ntear them down, recreate them, and then deploy workloads into those definitions. So, why does that really matter to you? Why does it matter to the rest of the business? Well, agility, security, isolation, performance, scalability - I could go on and on. But first I want to take you\nthrough the building blocks that have broken out into a few key areas to help\nyou understand truly what it is. The first building block is all about the\ncore components that make up VPC. VPC is an isolated logical network that you create, but the first thing that defines it is where it's located. In IBM Cloud we call this location a Multizone Region, or an MZR. A Multizone Region consists\nof at least three zones that are completely fault tolerant locations\nwithin that region that have absolutely no dependence on the other zone and\nallow you to deploy your applications in a resilient fashion. A VPC also defines\nat a high level the IP addresses that will be used for private communication\nwithin that VPC, again across that region. These IP addresses are further\nused and broken down by allowing you to create one or more subnets within each\nzone. So, now you're starting to build an IP network. You have complete control\nover this, create one subnet for a flat network, or introduce segmentation with\nmultiple subnets again in each zone. The next building block provides a component\nto allow you to secure your cloud deployments. Security Groups are a\nnetwork function that allows you to create rules that will either allow or\ndeny network communication in, out, and around the VPC. Now, that we've created\nour VPC and we've secured it, we need to get connectivity to it.\nIBM Cloud provides both public and private access and different components\nto provide connectivity for each of them. For internet or public access, we provide\npublic gateway, that's your outbound access. We also provide a floating IP\nthat you can tie to any of the cloud resources that you've deployed in your VPC, providing both inbound and outbound public access. For private connectivity,\nwe provide VPN as a Service, or traditional direct link private circuits.\nThis is so you can extend your enterprise into the IBM Cloud, or you can\neven connect your VPC to another VPC, or an outside resource. We're getting\nclose to deploying our workload in VPC but first let's talk about what network\nfunctions exist to help us with acceleration and availability. IBM Cloud\nprovides a Load Balancing as a Service, which is an application load balancer\ncapable of both HTTP, HTTPS with SSL offload and traditional TCP load balancing.\nNow, that we've built our VPC we've secured it and we have connectivity in\nand out of it, we can hand it over to our application teams to deploy their\nworkloads. IBM Cloud VPC is enabled today for virtual machines, deploy\ncustomizable infrastructure, or Kubernetes for those containerized\nworkloads. There are other capabilities in VPC that provides security like\nencrypt a block storage, or flexibility like image import, and much more. I hope\nall these building blocks help you understand the value and benefits that\nIBM Cloud VPC brings to you in your public cloud journey. Thank you.
