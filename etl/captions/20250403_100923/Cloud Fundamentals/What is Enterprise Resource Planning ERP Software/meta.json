An ERP system is a core enterprise   software and solution stack comprised of a \ncentral database surrounded by multiple plug-in   services and software packages, each of which is \ntailored to solve specific enterprise problems   and address specific challenges. At the core \nof all ERP solutions is a master database.   This database houses all the records that a \ncompany uses within all of its ERP solutions.   These records can be financial, like invoices and \npurchase orders. They can be related to payments,   like accounts payable and payroll and taxes. \nThey can be related to inventory status so that   a company knows what its supply lines are and how \nmany of all finished goods are available in every   warehouse. That core database also stores all \nof the sales data, what customers have ordered,   what products as well as details and specifics on \nthe internal processes to get that product from   the warehouse to the customer. But simply \nstoring the data by itself isn't useful.   The importance of an ERP system is to take all \nthe data that a company collects and use it   and integrate it so that that company can find \nways to increase efficiency and save on costs.   This is why there's always a data analytics piece \nthat wraps around the entirety of that core ERP,   database. This analytics engine is busy as it's \nconstantly creating reports on regular schedules   and updating the tables themselves. But it also \nhas to have the ability to provide data to users   on an ad hoc basis whenever a user has a specific \nquery that they need more information from. So for   all that data to flow correctly into the database \nand for the core functions of the ERP system to   work correctly. Let's talk about the most commonly \nimplemented modules that you'll find within an ERP   system. So that first module, that's going to be \nyour sales module, that is all of your sales data,   your order data, your customer data, so what \ncustomers buying, what things, where it's going,   shipping, tracking all of the PO information on \nhow it's getting paid for. In the payment status   you've got to track all of that sales data, \nbut in order to make sales happen you've   got to have product. In order to have product \nthat means that you've got to have procurement.   So, for procurement you've got to go out there, \nyou've got to track what materials am I buying,   who am I buying them from, where are they \ncoming from, am I getting the best deal,   am I doing all of the things that I need to do \nto acquire what I need to make my product. But   procurement goes so much further than that, it's \nnot just what does it take to make your product,   it's also “are you procuring what you need in \norder for your employees to keep up and running?   Are you buying things as complex \nas servers to go into a data farm,   and as simple as packages of ballpoint pens \nso that people have something to sign with?”.   All of those pieces go into that procurement \narea. And then in addition to the procurement,   you've got to have your production systems, \nright. Production is incredibly important   because you have to track that production from the \nvery beginning with your raw materials to the very   end with your finished product. And production is \ngoing to track everything in between, it's going   to do the planning, the capacity management, \nthe maintenance, the materials management,   being sure that the right things are being \nstaged at the right place at the right time   particularly as we've moved into this \njust in time manufacturing process   everywhere in the world so that we get as much \nefficiency in our manufacturing process as we can.   And so, after we finish that procurement, we might \nhave a distribution module, that module is going   to be concerned with how do we get our finished \nproducts from point A to the customer's door,   or just from point A to the loading dock door. \nSo that distribution model that's going to be   warehouse processes and staging goods, and \nmovement of finished goods, logistics control,   inventory control, stock levels trigger \nlevels all of those things that are necessary   from a logistics perspective because every \nbusiness runs with that logistics trail.   And so, your distribution modules have to keep \ntrack of all of that. They've got to run all   of it for you or you're just going to run into \ninefficiencies. And then related to manufacturing,   and still very important, you've got your asset \npieces, right. So, you've got your assets and you   have to track them. These are fixed assets, \ncapital assets, you have to know everything   about them. Not just the procedural information, \nwhat do you have, who made it, how does it work,   what's its status, does it have any maintenance \ncoming up, is it still under a service contract,   those things are important. Don't get me wrong, \nbut your finance department is going to insist   that you also have all of that finance related \ndata, what's the valuation of your asset,   what's its depreciation status, what is it is its \nexpected useful life, should they be planning on   a capital expenditure in order to replace it in a \ncertain number of years. Tracking all of that is   key to the asset. Part because, again, this fits \nin holistically and so all of these services,   these are all the back office ones. Back office \nis important, but also important is front office,   and this is the point where we should cut back \nto me doing this very nice scripted speech.   So, let's talk about these front office customer \nfacing or customer touching solutions, things like   customer relationship management, software, right. \nThat's your CRM piece. Why does CRM matter? Well   CRM matters because that's everything to do \nwith your relationship to that customer. It's   customer information, sales history, it's incoming \nleads on people who are potentially interested in   buying your products, it's opportunity from \nfirst identification to opportunity close,   it's all of your sales tracking data and your \npipeline information that you report out on.   All of that goes into that CRM system. That data \nis essential to knowing the status of your company   and knowing what your revenue is going to be \nas you track all of those opportunities from   open to close. And then in addition to your \nCRM suite, you've also got your HCM suite,   right. Human capital management, or HR software, \nthere's lots of different names for it,   but the same general idea how are you going out \nand sourcing new employees, how are you retaining   the ones that you already have, how are you being \nsure that everybody is being judged appropriately,   that annual reviews are going well, that all of \nthe back end processes necessary to onboard and   hire and maintain and pay your employees happen. \nAll of that goes into that HCM suite. And while   that might not necessarily be part of your ERP \nsystem it certainly falls within the umbrella   the larger category of what ERP is. And so, \nwhile it might be a tightly coupled system,   it might also be integrated in. It really \njust depends on which one you've picked.   And then also another tightly coupled system \nthat may or may not be part of the ERP suite   is your accounting system. Now some \ncompanies obviously choose to put their ERP   and their accounting software together, \nsome of them choose to break it apart,   but that accounting piece that is always going \nto be core because the data from the accounting   piece is going to feed back into everything else \nthat you're doing. Likewise, you're going to have   finance modules these are the ones that are more \ntightly coupled and probably built into the ERP   that are going to track all of those \nthings like your company investments,   company’s financial status, it's going to ingest \nall of that data we talked about before with your   assets and things like that. And it's going \nto track the financial health of your company   at a very high level. And that high level is \nprobably the most important part of your ERP   system because everything that we've talked \nabout, everything on this wheel right now,   this is about running the business from a very \noperational level. But the next step is not just   the operations piece it's the governance piece. \nSo we're going to remove this database and we're   going to remove these analytics engines, and we're \ngoing to put governance right here in the middle   because every module that we have, every one \nof these modules has to feed that data into the   holistic governance picture because executives \nat the boardroom level, or one step down from   the boardroom level, these executives are going \nto make the decisions that they have to make   about the future of the company. These are the \nstrategic level decisions based on inputs from   all of the modules within your ERP system. It's \nhow you look at the company health holistically,   and that's very different because it's a roll up \nof all of the data from all of the modules that   are in that, that are feeding into that database. \nAnd so, as we bring all of this data in we create   this roll-up reporting, we create this summary \nreporting, we put that into dashboards, right,   so that companies can go out and the C-suite can \nlook at a dashboard every morning that's going to   show them the holistic health of the company from \nevery factory they had, every location they have,   every distribution point, what's going on \nwith shipping, what's going on with retail,   what's going on with procurement, all of that data \nfeeds into the ERP, and it gives the executives   involved the ability to do those strategic \nlevel decisions. It's incredibly important,   all in all. Hopefully I've given you a good \noverview of what an ERP system is and why it's so   critical to the successful operation of any modern \ncompany. Your ERP system is always going to be   core to your daily operation and because of that \nselecting the right cloud provider for running   your ERP system is also critical. Your business is \n24/7, 365, and so must be the cloud on which you   run it. So if you'd like to talk more about how \nto implement a new ERP system from the ground up,   or how to transition your existing ERP system into \na modern one, you can learn more at ibm.com cloud   SAP, or you can reach out to your IBM \nSales team, or your IBM Business Partner   and we'd love to engage with you on how to improve \nyour whole company by improving your ERP system."
