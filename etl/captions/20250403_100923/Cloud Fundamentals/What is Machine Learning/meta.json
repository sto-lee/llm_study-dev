There's no doubt that this is an incredibly\nhot topic with significant interest from both business professionals as well as technologists.\nSo let's talk about what machine learning, or ML, is. So, before we get too far into the details,\nI want to take a minute to talk about some terms that are often used interchangeably\nbut have certain differences. Terms like “artificial intelligence”,\n“machine learning”, and even “deep learning”. So, at the highest level, AI is defined as\nleveraging computers or machines to mimic the problem-solving and the decision-making\ncapabilities of the human mind.  And machine learning is a subset within AI that's more\nfocused on the use of various self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data\nin order to predict outcomes. And then, finally, deep learning is a further\nsubset within even machine learning, and deep learning is often thought of as scalable machine\nlearning because it automates a lot of the feature extraction process away and eliminates\nthe some of the human intervention involved to enable the use of some really, really big\ndata sets. But for today we'll focus just on machine\nlearning, so we'll get rid of the other two and dive one level deeper and talk about the\ndifferent types of machine learning. Ok. So, the first type that we have is called\n“supervised learning”.  And this is when we use labeled data sets to train algorithms\nto classify data or predict outcomes. And when I say labeled, I mean that the rows\nin the data set are labeled, tagged, or classified in some interesting way that tells us something\nabout that data. So, it could be a yes or a no, or it could\nbe a particular category of some, you know, different attribute. OK, so how do we apply supervised machine\nlearning techniques? Well, this really depends on your particular\nuse-case. We could be using a classification model  which recognizes and groups ideas or objects into predefined categories. An example of this in the real world is with\ncustomer retention. So, if you're in the business of managing\ncustomers, one of your goals is typically minimizing and identifying customer churn,\nright, which are customers that no longer buy a particular product or service, and we\nwant to avoid churn because it's almost always more costly to acquire a new customer than\nit is to retain an existing one, right? So, if we have historical data for the customer,\nlike their activity - whether they churned or not, right - we can build a classification\nmodel using supervised machine learning, and our labeled data set that will help us identify\ncustomers that are about to churn, and then allow us to take action to retain them. OK, so the other type of supervised learning\nis regression. Now, this is when we build an equation using\nvarious input values with their specific weights determined by the overall value of their impact\non the outcome. And we use these to generate an estimate for\nan output value. So, let me give you another example here. So, airlines rely heavily on machine learning,\nand they use regression techniques to accurately predict how much they should be charging for\na particular flight, right? So, they use various input factors like, you\nknow, days before departure, the day of the week, the departure, the destination to use\nthese to predict an accurate dollar value for how much they should be charging for a\nspecific flight that will maximize their revenue. OK, so now let's move on to the second type\nof machine learning which is  “unsupervised learning”. OK, so this is when we use machine learning\nalgorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets, and this method helps us discover\nhidden patterns or groupings without the need for human intervention, right? So, we're using unlabeled data here. So, again, let's talk about the different\ntechniques for unsupervised learning. One method is “clustering”.  And a real-world\nexample of this is when organizations try to do  customer segmentation. Right.  So, when businesses try to do effective marketing\nit's really critical that they really understand who their customers are, right, so that they\ncan connect with them in the most relevant way. And, oftentimes, it's not obvious or clear\nhow certain customers are similar to or different from one another, right, and clustering algorithms\ncan help take into account a variety of information on the customer like their purchase history, you know, their social media activity, or website activity,  could be their geography, and much more, to group similar customers into buckets so that we can send them more\nrelevant offers, provide them better customer service, and be more targeted with our marketing\nefforts. Ok. And the last point I want to touch on\nfor unsupervised learning is called “dimensionality reduction”. So, we won't discuss this in detail in this\nvideo, but this refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a\ndata set so we don't let some redundant parameters over represent the impact on the on the outcome. Ok. So the last type of machine learning I\nwant to talk about today is called “reinforcement learning”. Now, this is a form of semi-supervised learning\nwhere we typically have an agent or system take actions  in an environment. Now the environment will then either reward\nthe agent for correct moves,  or punish it for incorrect moves. Right. And, through many iterations of this, we can\nteach a system a particular task. Now a great example of this method in the\nreal world is with self-driving cars. So, autonomous driving has several factors,\nright? There's the speed limit, there are drivable\nzones, there are collisions, and so on. So, we can use forms of reinforcement learning\nto teach a system how to drive by avoiding collisions, following the speed limit, and\nso on. OK, so we covered many topics today, but you know,  we've barely scratched the surface of each one. If you found any one particular aspect of\nmachine learning interesting, I encourage you to dive deeper and learn more about it.\nAnd if you want to know what are some of the common machine learning algorithms and how\nto leverage them in data science, please check out some of the links in the description.
