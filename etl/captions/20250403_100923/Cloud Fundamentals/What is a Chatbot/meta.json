How do I interact   with it? Let's dive in. My name is Morgan Carroll \nwith IBM Cloud. Let's say you're the owner of a   flower shop, this is you. And you're the only \nemployee, maybe you don't have time to respond   to common customer inquiries, such as what time \ndo you open, do you have yellow roses in stock,   how do I contact you. So you've got your customer \nup here and they need to get in touch with you,   but you're busy you can't answer the phone. So \nwhat can we do to solve this problem? This is   where Flora, the floral chatbot comes in. This is \nFlora over here. Now if a customer has a simple   question, let's say they just want to know, um, \nwhat time do you guys open. They can ask Flora   \"hey what time do you all open?\", and \nthen Flora is going to be able to respond   with the appropriate answer. She's going to say, \nyou know, maybe \"we open Monday at 9 AM.\" All   without me having to interact with the chatbot, or \nthe customer, so that I'm free to do what I love   to do which is designing floral arrangements. \nNow let's think of a more complex example.   Say you have the bank here, and you as the \ncustomer you would like to check and see   what your balance is. So I just got paid I don't \nknow how much money is in the bank but I need   to go buy some socks. So rather than having to \ncall the bank and wait on hold, and wait for a   teller to pull up your information, and check your \naccount status, you could actually interact with   Birdie, the banking bot. So in this \ncase I'm going to ask Birdie, \"Birdie,   what is my balance? How much money do I have \ncurrently?\" Bertie's going to come back and ask,   \"I can help you with that, but what is your \naccount number, your pin number?\", you know   some identifying information. So I'm going to be \nable to provide this information back to Birdie.   My account number, maybe my date of \nbirth, a pin number, etc., etc. From there   all without any tellers or any employees having \nto interact with Birdie, she's going to be able   to go and ask the bank, she's going to pass \nalong all this information, my account number,   my date of birth, and my pin number, and she's \ngoing to say \"hey bank, how much money does this   person have in their account?\" The bank is going \nto authorize me and say \"okay this is all the   appropriate information that we need.\" The bank \nis going to respond with \"I'm sorry you only have   five dollars\", maybe enough for socks, maybe not. \nBut then Birdie is going to be able to take that   response and pass it back to me, the customer, \nall without having to interact with any humans   and it's very simple. So how does this really \nwork? Let's dive in. Going back to the floral shop   example. Let's say tomorrow is Mother's Day and \nyou forgot to order flowers like we normally do.   So here's you, my customer. Now like we mentioned \nbefore, the floral shop owner is very busy,   she's putting together all these arrangements, \nshe doesn't really have time to answer the phone.   So luckily there are a few different \nways that you the user can interact   with our chatbot to actually automate \nordering some flowers for your mother.   So, on the floral shop website there could be a \nlittle pop-up, maybe at the bottom that has Flora.   This is Flora, the floral bot, and she's here \nand she's going to be able to pop-up and ask   me \"what kind of flowers would you like to \norder?\" Obviously yellow roses because those   are my mother's favorite. If we don't want to \nuse the website, we could actually just call in.   So it can be either text based or voice based. \nSo, if I call the chatbot she says \"Welcome to   Flower Supply 101, what would you like to place \nyour order for?\" I would say \"I would like a dozen   yellow roses\", and it's just conversational. \nAnd she's going to take my order and be able   to process it and you can also use various instant \nmessaging services, you know, for different social   media platforms you can integrate. So you have \nall these different ways that you can interact   with the chatbot. Now let's think about how \nthat actually works, sort of on the backend.   So I think by now we're all familiar with the \ncloud, it's the buzzword of the year. This is   actually where our chatbot is going to live. So \nyou'll have a chatbot service provider and this   chatbot is going to integrate with various \nservices to actually process whatever speech   it is that the user is saying. It's going to use \nNatural Language Processing, as well as Artificial   Intelligence, to take what i'm saying and then \nactually translate it into something that a   computer can understand. So, I'm saying whether \nit's via phone or via instant messenger, or to   the webpage via text or voice, I would like to \npurchase some yellow roses. So I'll say \"purchase   yellow roses\", and maybe I want to do a dozen. \nMaybe next year I'll do two dozen, I should.   So then it's gonna pass this, I'm gonna pass this \ninformation to either the web page or IM or voice.   This is actually, whatever this medium \nis, it's going to send this information   up to the cloud. Now the cloud is going to take \nthis and it's going to process it. It's going to   say \"I see that the user wants to purchase this \nspecific item\", in this case 12 yellow roses.   Now we have to make sure that we actually have \nthese roses in stock, you know, if i try to place   an order and then I pay for it and then I get a \nnotice sorry we're out of stock well that's just   not a good user experience. So the way this is \ngoing to work is we'll use various cloud services   and we're actually going to go over here and \nconnect to what I'm going to call floral systems.   And this is basically just going \nto be our database on the backend,   and it's going to show, you know, maybe I \nhave 36 yellow roses in stock. I've also got,   let's say, 14 red tulips, and 3 succulents. Succulents. So, I've sent this information to \nthe webpage already as the user now the webpage   is going to say \"all right, purchase\", and then \n12 roses, yellow roses. Now this is going to   send this information to the cloud to my chatbot \nservice provider, and then that is actually going   to go out here and check the database. So I'll \nsay \"12 yellow roses is what we're looking for\",   and then we can see we've actually got 36. \nSo we have plenty of roses, this is good.   So now we're going to send a \nresponse back. We're going to say   \"Yes, we have more than enough roses in stock. \nSo we can go ahead and place this order\".   And the cloud is going to come back and say \"Yes \nlet's place this order.\" And then the webpage is   going to come back to me and say \"Absolutely, \nyou're in luck. You didn't wait too long. Maybe   next year try to do it a little quicker, \nbut we're going to be able to fulfill your   order.\" So then I'm over here the whole time as, \nlet's say I'm over here, the floral shop owner. And I'm just building floral arrangements. Maybe \nI'll get a notification kind of off to the side,   but all in all the whole thing is automated so \nI don't have to stop what I'm doing to actually   take care of this, and it's \ngoing to save me a lot of time.   Now let's talk about the benefits of, you know, \nwhy would we want to use a chatbot. I mean it   is it is nice to have that human interaction \nwhenever you're dealing with your customers, but   I think probably the number one reason that \nsomeone may want to use a chatbot is to save   time. And what I mean by that is, you know, \nnot only are you saving time when it comes to   like interacting with your customers \nand getting someone to place an order,   but again, you're leaving time off to \nthe side for you to go, and you know,   maybe you've got to do some bookkeeping, you've \ngot to put these floral arrangements together,   whatever it is, it's going to save you hours \nand hours over the course of even just a month. Two. Simplicity. Chatbots believe it or not are surprisingly \nsimple to build. You don't have to know how   to write any code in most cases, if you want to do \nmore in-depth integrations, you might need to know   some code, but for the most part it's just natural \nlanguage based. You could say \"Hey chatbot,   I want you to tell users that I'm open Monday \nthrough Friday 9 AM to 6 PM\", and it's going to be   able to relay that information without having to \nknow any Python, or JavaScript, or anything like that. Lastly, time to launch. So what that means \nis that it does not take a lot of time to build   a chatbot. Like I said earlier, you don't have \nto know any code, and since it's cloud-based   you don't have to build up any of the underlying \ninfrastructure. From the time you start building   the chatbot to the time it's completed could be \nas quick as one hour. And so, these are some of   the reasons that you may want to build a chatbot \nfor your business. So I hope this helped explain   what a chatbot is, how it works, and why you \nmay want to use it.
