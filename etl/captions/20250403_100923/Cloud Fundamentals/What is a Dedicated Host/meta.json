Dedicated host is a construct that \nyou see a lot in the world of cloud,   but it's a little confusing. What does this \ndedicated host thing actually mean? Why does it   look like it's so expensive when you compare it \nto buying a dedicated instance or just a normal   virtual server? And the answer is dedicated \nhosts are a way to provide single tenancy.   Single tenancy means that no one else can \nrun on the compute that you are running on. So, if we think about a physical cloud host, \nright, we've got our actual cloud server here.   This is the actual host that runs in the data \ncenter. In a normal multitenant environment,   we would take, and we would divide that host up \ninto pieces, and every one of these pieces as a   virtual server that you would buy. I'll just mark \nthat as VSI. In a dedicated host, we still have   the same host, that same box that we were talking \nabout before. But instead, this is your box,   and you control all of the VSIs that schedule on \nto it. So instead of this being customer A, and   this being customer B, and this being customer C, \nthis is all yours. And so you can choose to divide   it up however you want. You can have one third of \nit go into one VSI and two thirds go into another.   You can divide it half and half, or you \ncan put lots of little bitty ones on it. And so, the question, of course, always \nbecomes, why would I do this, what is the   value of a dedicated host? Why would I purchase \nthis thing? And the answer is really twofold. First is that single tenancy that I mentioned \nbefore. Single tenancy means that you don't   have to worry about anybody else being able \nto crash through the hypervisor layer within   this host and get to your data. Even though it's \nalready incredibly secured in the world of cloud,   it's just one more layer of protection. This \nis very important for health care workloads,   folks in banking and finance like that. But in addition to that single tenancy, \nit also allows you to schedule workloads   that want to be close to be each other, close to \neach other. So, if we think of our example here,   where we've got two VSIs of the same size, let's \nimagine a high-performance compute workload,   something that in the world of HPC, where you \nhave lots of compute working on the same problem.   In order to minimize latency and maximize \nperformance, you want to pack these onto a few   physical hosts as possible because data transit \nthrough a physical host is much faster than data   that goes across the network. If we think about \nour example over here, where we've got our multi   tenancy, and we've got multiple multitenant \nboxes, every one of these has to link together,   and that link together takes time. There is a \nlatency penalty that you pay. But in a dedicated   host like we have over on this side, because these \nall run on the same physical box, you don't incur   that latency penalty and you can order multiple \ndedicated hosts in order to make that happen.
