Well, today I'm going break it down. VPC, or \"Virtual Private Cloud\", is a public cloud capability that provides you the ability to define and then control isolated virtual networks and then deploy cloud resources into those networks. So, what is a virtual network? Well, to help you understand that, let me first help you understand how we would deploy networks in a standard public cloud. An administrator is going to find a backbone,\nnow that backbone is going to carry all the traffic in that cloud. There's going to be some segmentation on that\nbackbone to create a separation between one client and another client. Or let's even say\nseparation between one application and another application within that same client. So, now that we have that segmentation, we\nneed a network function that will actually allow us to have communication between those\nsegments. A network function we're going to call router. So, now that we have communication between\nthese segments I might choose to say I don't want traffic to flow between this segment\nand that segment. Let's say because this is customer A and this\nis customer B. So, now I have a firewall function that provides\nus with filtering capabilities. So, now I have my cloud defined, it's completely\nisolated, it's not connected to the rest of the world, but I need internet connectivity\nbecause I'm hosting web application here. So, now I need a network function that can\nprovide me with NAT-ing. In addition, I need to extend my enterprise.\nOr I have applications here that need to communicate and get data from my enterprise on site. So, I'm going to build a VPN function. So, in a traditional cloud environment most\nof all these network functions are actually done with appliances. There done with appliances\nthat require infrastructure administrators, or network administrators to log into them\nusing proprietary interface to define all these flows and controls. If you look at virtual networking, however\nwe introduce all of these capabilities as a service. For which in case, we introduce\nall these capabilities to the user where they can now create these functions and create\nthis isolation and the segmentation with a UI or CLI or API. So, they might be able to say I want four\nof these networks, and I want to find my own custom segmentation for this application for\nthat application. Now I want to have connectivity to my enterprise,\nI provision a VPN service to get connectivity to the internet instead of having to configure\nNAT-ing I provided, I provision a service to be able to be able to give me that ability. So, now the user has this control and they\ndidn't need to know any proprietary interfaces to make these connections are defined these\nflows, and since each of these are networks, they are completely isolated with each other.\nThey don't have connectivity between each network until I say so. So, let's talk about a few the benefits. Now\nyou understand where the virtual network comes into play and how that actually contributes\nto the private piece of V. P. C. So, some of the benefits are because now I\ncan get all these all these functions and I have isolation built in I have some security\naspects. In addition, since these are not appliances\nand actually provided has a capability of the cloud, I can do all of this at scale. Again, developers need things that are customizable\nright. So, the aspect of being able to find the segmentation and say I want four, five,\nor six, or tear it all down and come back tomorrow to do it again, I need some aspects\nof customizing this environment. In addition, it's flexible enough \nto allow the user to be able to say I need to be able to add virtual segmentation later\non down the road, or I need connectivity to the enterprise down the road. So, these two attributes here actually allow\nthe developers to become more agile which hopefully is going to save you some money.\nSo, now you understand what virtual private cloud is and why it matters to you.
