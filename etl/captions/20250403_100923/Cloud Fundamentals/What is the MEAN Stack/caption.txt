are you a veteran lamp stack developer looking to somehow evolve to your next generation platform if so you're going to love our topic today hello my name is jamil spang developer advocate with ibm cloud and today my topic is going to be concerning the acronym mean but it's not going to be meaning that perspective we're going to be very nice and code up some great things here so as usual whenever we get started i love to break down the acronyms and then we'll hit the whiteboard and show you how all these components kind of fit together so let's break this acronym down we have the mean the m of course which is going to stand for db talking about the main data store that's a component of that we have the e which stands for express express.js we all know it's a web application framework built on top of javascript the a is for angular all right spa application uh development there and then as more of the platform we're gonna go with the n which is no js and so if you recall from my previous video on the lamp stack this is more centered around linux apache php does a lot of the work of course there's a data store option there which is my sequel and now we're going to take this to the next step with the mean platform and we'll talk about a couple of variations that can occur as well so i'm going to get started by as usual drawing out things how they are and we're going to have a couple of layers here but this is going to be quite common that we're going to have so let's think of it like this let's start with our foundation here and the first foundation is going to be node.js all right the node.js has quickly grown over the decades to being quite an impressive language evolving to not only a front end with javascript a frontside scripting language to now even working on the server side and one of the most popular packages that most applications are developed in is let's see if i can squeeze that in is the express web application framework all right it's going to install as a part of the node.js computing language it will bring up the ability to quickly let you scale up web applications built upon that not only can you define your routes but also it'll be that piece that kind of can make connections to the database all right so we're going to deal with mongodb here so the express will have all the modules that are used to kind of function and run make connections to the database make expose other routes as well as connect to any other kind of languages that are there it's all part of the javascript models there if you're familiar with the mpm package manager you can simply import packages make references to require them inside of express routes or or or models there and then work with everything so on top of that the last part we'll talk about is the a which stands for angular and this is going to fit in to be what we like to call our single page applications so everyone's familiar with angular one of the popular frameworks for building spa applications from google and what this is going to do is really take control of the complete front end that's there spa applications as you know in comparison to traditional page applications is really just going to have that main entry level loading so maybe that first route and then it only declaratively refreshes pages of the page that you want to um pretty much that you focus on so one i want to kind of describe that a little bit more let's say our web page comes in and it's with a header and a menu and then content here so as i click links here only this part will actually refresh as i click links all right whereas in most traditional page applications the whole page would refresh and you have to constantly deal with loading times from that so what this does is pretty much allows you to build in these modern interfaces and most of the most modern applications are coming as spa applications single page applications there express is the framework that serves that out when angular needs to make connections to a database is pretty much going to talk to the express framework which will make the connection to  which will give the response back and then serve it back to that session there as well and of course angler is free to make any other ajax calls as it needs now you're probably thinking to yourself mean okay well what if i don't use angular what if i use another popular language which is one that i use a lot react and so yes you can substitute different parts here to do different things all right um often i've made my acronym i guess that makes it mern all right the  express react and um and node.js that's there so you can often switch out any component that you are looking to use that can really fit your scenario here so that's all for now this is the mean stack i encourage you to go check it out it was naturally my next evolution after i became an expert at building lamp steps stacks and then wanted to make my move into more fluid single page using mongodb because everything's done as a document json document everything's flexible fluid fast to develop and nothing beats the experience of a single page application so that's all
