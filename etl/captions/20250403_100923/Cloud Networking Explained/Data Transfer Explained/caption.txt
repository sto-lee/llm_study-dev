hi I'm Ryan Sumner and I'm with the IBM cloud team today we're going to talk about data transfer in and out of the cloud data transfer means a lot to different people but to me I focus on the connectivity or the network communication that occurs when transferring data in and out of the cloud really focus in on that I like to use the metaphor of a road trip for a road trip you you really you really focus in on what you're gonna be taking on your trip right where you're gonna go how much stuff you're gonna need to take with you you start to think about the arrival time when you need to get there the the route you're gonna take which helps you define really the departure time and then you know the risks and the other kind of add-ons that you might want during that trip how many stops you might want to take and then you might actually start reiterating over that process as you're thinking about your road trip now we're communication and connectivity is very similar to that you really start to think about some of the risks associated with the trip you're taking because you're concerned about data privacy right you start to think about how much data you need to transfer right so the size of that data you also start to think about how long is it going to take which helps understand how much throughput or how much speed do I really need to make this trip successful so as we take this trip across the internet or public trip we start down the road and we hit these hops these are called network hops each one of these hop hops actually caused a change in the direction of of our traffic because it's an intersection point on the internet for traffic to continue to go in another direction or traffic to eventually get to our destination that we're very interested in so as we're going along we actually have very little control over how our data transfers from our enterprise to the cloud if it's a hundred percent internet-based because there might be outages somewhere across the internet that we have no control over so where we thought we might be going this way we actually might get deferred in this general direction which for our case might actually be a faster trip but back to the point you have very little control over the way the data transfers the quality of services we like to call it in the industry is is fairly erratic you have you know you can't create SL a's around the quality of service across the internet because a lot of those things are outside of your control so a lot of enterprises start to shift their thought process into a private connectivity pattern so if we fir that back to our roadtrip analogy you you're now really creating a dedicated point-to-point connectivity or point-to-point trip or road to get from your enterprise to the cloud so again where are some of these what are some of the benefits here that we that we can start to appreciate here if we think about security right so so now I may not necessarily need to encrypt my data because now I have a private communication between my enterprise and the cloud and I don't have ease droppers I have a little bit better control around the quality of service because I'm really dealing with myself a network provider and my cloud provider to get me from point A to point B I now have more direct control over the number of hops that I have to go through which will affect my latency and will affect my speed and so now I can actually dictate and put specific controls over exactly how much bandwidth or how large of a road do I need to build between my enterprise and the cloud so all these things start to really make sense if you really break it down and do simple math and think about simple risks and tie them back to my metaphor really you can simplify the the challenges of data transfer and network connectivity to the cloud thank you if you have any questions please drop us a line below if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like it and subscribe and don't forget you can always get started on the cloud at no cost by signing up for a free IBM cloud account
