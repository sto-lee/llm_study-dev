I am Pooja, from IBM team and I'm going to explain to you how DNS works. DNS in short is called the Domain Name System. The domain name system translates domain names to IP addresses, and what is a \ndomain and what is an IP address?   Let's take a look at that. First, let's see what a domain name is. A domain name is any text or string that you \nbasically enter in your web page.    It could be ibm.com, google.com, abc.com, any of these. And what really is an IP address? IP address is a four set number, goes like this. Just going to write a random number for you here. I'm pretty sure you have all seen \nthis IP address almost every day  when you access these websites and says \noh you know your web browser is down.   You know, you're not able to access \nthe DNS that you're looking for. So, let's take an example, abc.com. What happens is, instead of typing abc.com, if you \ntype in the IP address of that particular website   in your web browser you will actually  \nbe routed to the web page. Now, the main component of the DNS system is the DNS resolver. So, the DNS resolver acts as the \nphone book in this entire thing. How do we bridge the gap between  \nthe human communication and the DNS, and the networking world? So, in the networking world the computers \nuse numbers to communicate with each other, and in the human world we use names to communicate with \neach other, and here DNS resolver acts as a phone   book where you search the name and match it to the \nnumber. The IP address is the internet protocol   that has a set of rules that helps millions of \ndevices communicate with each other and that's   why we have these IP addresses allocated \nto each and every device on the internet.   All these devices communicate using this \nunique identifier, and since as humans   we are not accustomed to remembering names, we \nuse these domain names, to remembering numbers,   we use the domain names and that's how we \nresolve using the DNS resolver. Now that   we know an overview of the domain name system \nlet's take a look at how the DNS lookup happens. So the first step in the DNS lookup is the user.   This is where we enter the website address from \nour web page and you are going to be the actor   here. So, the web browser has what we call the \ncache memory. The cache memory stores certain   values for a certain time period of time. So, when \nyou enter the address abc.com let's say, what   happens is it looks in the cache memory first and \nwhen we say, \"oh, i don't have the IP address of   the particular website that you're looking for,\" \nwe forward the request to the main DNS resolver.   So this is going to be our \nDNS resolver for the day, and now from here the DNS \nresolver has its own cache. It looks at its cache and says \"hey, i don't have \nthe IP address of the particular website that you   are looking for. So what i'm going to do is i'm \ngoing to route your request to the root server.\"   I'm going to use a different \ncolor. So, this is the root server   and root server is the top server at \nthe top level in the DNS hierarchy,   and the root server still doesn't have the \ninformation of abc.com that you're looking for,   but what it does have is the information \nabout the top level domain server   that you have to route your request to. Also the \nroot server is placed across different locations   throughout the world there are almost \nhundreds of these root servers placed,   and there are 12 different organizations that \nmanage these root servers, and from there we   get the top level domain server's IP address. \nSo, now we send the request to the TLD server. And the TLD is nothing but \"Top Level Domain\", \nwhich basically means it has all the information   for the top level domain, and in this \ncase the top level domain is going to be   a dot com. So it could be anything like dot \nnet, dot org, as such. What it does say is   \"hey, i don't have the ip address of abc.com, but \ni can send your request to the authoritative name   server. I can send the IP address to which \nyou need to send your request to, and the   authoritative name server has all the information \nand all the DNS records that we need to access.   So basically the authoritative name server \nrenders the DNS records that we need to access. So the request is sent to the auth name server,   oh and we can also call it as the domain \nname server, and lot of cloud providers   across all over the world provide this server \nability, and you can use multitude of them. So this is going to be our authoritative name \nserver, and what the authoritative name server   does it sends back the IP address of the \nparticular website that we are looking for,   and now we get the IP address back to the \nDNS resolver so the DNS resolver now stores   it in the cache. I store it in the cache \nand I send it back to the web browser,   and now the web browser has the IP address \nthat it was looking for. What it does is it   sends the request to the particular web server \nthat points in the IP address that's been sent.   So, this is the web server of any particular \nwebsite that you're probably accessing. In   this case it is going to be abc.com. So, now \nthe web server has all the content that is   needed to display in your web page. What we \nrender back is the content of your web page. This is the entire working of our DNS lookup and \nthis is what we almost do in every day when we   access different websites all over the internet. \nI hope you find this video very informative.
