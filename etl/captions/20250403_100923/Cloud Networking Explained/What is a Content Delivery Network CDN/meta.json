So, in short, a Content Delivery Network,\nor CDN, is a service that accelerates internet content delivery. So, in other words the main benefit of a CDN\nis that it makes your website faster. So, before I get into describing to you how\nit accomplishes that and some of the other benefits. First, I want to talk to you about some of\nthe challenges that we have where we have users all around the world, but we don't have\nservers all around the world and the experience that those users have due to that dynamic. So, I got a simple diagram here showing a\nserver hosted down in Dallas, this is my website, and I have users all around the world. So, in Sydney I might have five, in London\nI've got five, New York I might have ten, and LA I might have ten. I’ve thirty users around the world they're\naccessing my server and my website down in Dallas. So, lets you can follow a set of these users\nin their journey and let's look at their users down in Sydney. They make a request to the website they got\nan eighty six hundred mile hike to Dallas and then in eighty-six hundred mile hike back. The amount of time that that takes is usually\nmeasured in milliseconds and just that round trip might be about a hundred and seventy\nmilliseconds. For our users up in London that might be about\na hundred milliseconds. Our users in New York City can probably experience\nabout a forty milliseconds round-trip time. And over in LA about thirty. So, as you can see, the further you’re away,\nthe longer it takes and ultimately the slower the website will be for you. So, this is where the CDN comes into play\nand this is how it actually accomplishes the increase in speed which is by reducing the\namount of distance between the user and the content, or the server providing the content. So, what it does by doing that it places these\nContent Delivery Network end points in as many locations around the world as possible. And in our case, we're going to assume we've\ngot one in just about every location where users exist. So, now when the user in Sydney, or London,\nor New York City, or LA tries to access some content its first retrieved by the Content\nDelivery Network service and then distributed around the world. So, we have a single request down to the Dallas\nserver. It's now the distributed all around the world. And our users in London now instead of going\nall the way to Dallas they're able to retrieve that content directly from their closest geographical\nlocation, drastically reducing the amount of time that it takes to retrieve that content. So, as you can see here it's a very basic\nhow a CDN is able to provide the benefits of to the end user by reducing the amount\nof time that it takes to deliver the service, but what you're not seen here is an indirect\nbenefit is the reduction in the amount of traffic that actually hits the Dallas server. So, the indirect benefit is that you actually\nsee a reduction in the load, or the reduction in the amount of capacity that you need in\nDallas to serve all these users. So, another indirect benefit because there\nis much less validity and so much less stuff happening in Dallas, because all these users\nare not having to make these trips, and I'm also not having to communicate with users\nso far away. The Dallas environment may also see an increase\nin up time. And then lastly because the users are not\nreally directly communicating with the server down in Dallas you have the indirect benefit\nof an increase in security through obscurity. So, it's pretty basic to understand how a\nCDN works, in the end it provide a better benefit to the end user. Thanks for watching this overview of Content\nDelivery Network.
