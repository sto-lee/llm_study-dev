While the possibilities are endless I\nbelieve the most consequential will be secure application development name is\nSridhar Muppidi, I'm the CTO for IBM Security. Our clients\nare going through a digital transformation journey,\nthey're modernizing applications data and infrastructure.\nIBM delivers a number of security solutions to help our clients\nprotect detect and respond, but the reality is that security\nprofessionals that use our offerings are inundated\nwith too many things to do, too much of data,\nvery little time, and too few skills. AI can have a huge impact on cyber security\nsolutions and the professionals. Since the\ninception of AI we've learned that to make at the right\nAI system we need the right data we need to train\nthe AI model on the right data test it for bias\nas well as to ensure that it is robust on the solution side. AI can help us\nprovide accuracy in detection ai can help in\naccelerating the investigation and automating the response\nit can also help provide proactive mechanisms of protection\nso that you're safeguarding against threats we made a massive investment on\nAI, and IBM and 100 of our products use\nAI my favorite solution is how we use AI to do a continuous verification of a\nuser based on behavioral biometrics this helps us evaluate the risk of a\nspecific user for a specific session. So based on that we're able to subject\nthe user to right amount of friction. If the risk is low we don't need to\nsubject the user from multiple passwords on the other hand if the risk is high\nyou may want to prompt the user for a password or even a second\nfactor authentication. We're very fortunate to have a large\nnumber of our clients using our solutions across\nnumber of different industry verticals. A few that come to my mind\nare Wimbledon suggested as well as RGS Nordic this is exactly\nwhere we apply AI's speed and accuracy to help\ncreate proactive protection improve the accuracy of detection accelerate the\ninvestigation as well as improve the automation\nin response. We have a lot more to learn and\nevolve the maturity of AI in the next few decades to come.\nWhile the possibilities are endless my vision is for AI\nto develop secure applications by default\nso that they are not as vulnerable and reduce the number of breaches\nin the industry I believe IBM is well poised to not only help with the secure\napplication development, but also secure data across hybrid cloud\nas well as secure infrastructure this ability to secure\nthe journey to hybrid cloud will help our clients embrace digital\ntransformation with a lot more confidence."
