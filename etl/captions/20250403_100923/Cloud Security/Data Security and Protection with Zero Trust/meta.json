There are a number of security \nproducts driving these security solutions.   And certainly, the security \nteams are always inundated with   too many alerts, too many products, \nand too many solutions to keep up with.  Data security is a constantly evolving and \na moving target. So when we talk about the   challenges of data security, it's all about having \nan understanding of what data an organization has,   understand what are some of the compliance \nmandates the organization needs to comply with.   And more importantly, be able to get to a \nmore proactive state where organizations are   managing and remediating security threats as they \narise. And that's really where Zero Trust light   frameworks come into picture. Zero Trust ensures \nthat you are verifying everything and not really   banking on trusting anything without verification.\nPrivacy and data security and governance are   interrelated. They are two phases \nof the same coin in the sense that   privacy is something that you could drive with \nhaving a robust data governance process and having   a very solid framework to enforce data governance \nfrom a security point of view. And that's really   where data security solutions come in to play.\nIBM believes the current state of data security   can be improved. We believe the market from here \ngoes towards more of an open and interconnected   space where security solutions could talk to \neach other and essentially enable security   orchestration and response in a more congenial and \nmore homogenous way. And IBM Security solutions   are built using some of the security first \nprinciples like separation of duties, being   able to deliver data-centric security controls \nand ultimately drive all this in a way that is   enabling security teams to manage data security \nthreats and prioritize actions and remediation.  What that provides is the ability \nfor organizations to have their teams   across the board from compliance to privacy, \nfrom risk management to applications,   infrastructure to operations, all come together \nto address business challenges and particularly   data security threats and events in a more \ncollaborative way. My name is Rajesh Venkatasubbu,   product manager at IBM Security, and responsible \nfor data security and guardian data protection."
