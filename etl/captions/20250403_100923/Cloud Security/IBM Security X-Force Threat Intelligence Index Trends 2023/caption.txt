what do back doors ransomware catfishing extortion and exploitation have in common they are some of the top trends we identified in this year's X-Force threat intelligence index attackers followed the money and right now persistent access to corporate environments go for a lot of money on the dark web making back doors a profitable commodity for attackers representing 21 percent of cases back doors which are malware offering attackers remote access to compromise systems were the most common action observed in incidents in 2022 knocking out ransomware which held the top spot since 2020. attackers often use back doors or persistent access to execute ransomware attacks unless more businesses put their defenses on the offense today's backdoor problem will turn into tomorrow's ransomware crisis representing 17 percent of attacks worldwide ransomware was the second most common action observed in 2022 an exor study revealed that while there's been a slight decline in the prevalence of ransomware a taxed up 94 percent less time over the last few years thread hijacking attempts doubled compared to 2021. threat hijacking another form of catfishing is when an attacker compromises a victim's email account and replies to a recent email thread impersonating the victim by hijacking an email thread adversaries can trick a target's friends family even co-workers into providing access to sensitive information data or systems creating a chain reaction with multiple victims extortion is a battle tested technique that exerts pressure levers to inflict maximum pain on a victim organization and the latest scheme is involving customers and business partners as pawns extortion was the top impact observed in 2022 more than one quarter of attacks involved some form of extortion for the second year in a row manufacturing was the most extorted industry extortion accounted for 30 percent of incidents in manufacturing and 27 percent in all Industries even as the number of vulnerabilities disclosed hit another record high the proportion of weaponized exploits to reported vulnerabilities has been trending down from 2018 to 2022 exploits relative to vulnerabilities dropped by more than nine percent attackers have access to nearly 78 000 known exploits making it easier to use an existing exploit left unpatched rather than investing time and resources into developing a new one in 2022 X-Force observed several incidents resulting from three to five year old exploits so what can you do use adversary simulation to understand an attacker's view of both known and unknown risks this can help organizations take preventative measures before an incident happens take steps to protect yourself from thread hijacking such as using strong and unique passwords and enabling multi-factor Authentication for organizations that have a low threshold for downtime they need to have a proactive cyber security strategy including active threat assessment playbooks and other cyber range activities and remember to operate under the assumption of an assumed breach assume an attacker already has access to your environment and is moving around be proactive not reactive stop focusing on the perimeter start focusing on detection and response prioritize your security and when
