And do you need new skills \nor additional DevOps workflows to adopt them?  \n   Hi, I am Pratheek Karnati, Security Architect \nfor IBM Cloud. Today, we are going to talk about   Confidential Computing, and specifically, how \neasy it is to adopt TEEs and to protect your   cloud workloads using IBM Cloud Data Shield.  \n \nBriefly, let’s talk about Confidential Computing…   At a high-level confidential computing protects \ndata through encryption and isolation of memory,   which complements your data in transit encryption \n(using TLS) and at rest encryption (envelope   encryption using a root key) for a true end \nto end data protection. And this cryptographic   isolation of memory happens either at VM or \nat process level. You can think of it as a   VM level cryptographic isolation or a process \nlevel cryptographic isolation. For today, let’s   focus on process level cryptographic solutions…  \n \n…or secure enclaves… let’s look at Intel Software   Guard Extensions (SGX) and how Data Shield can \nhelp you adopt Intel SGX with no code changes! \n   Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a set \nof security-related instruction codes that are   built into some modern Intel central processing \nunits (CPUs). They allow user-level as well   as operating system code to define private regions \nof memory, again enclaves, whose contents are   protected and unable to be either read or saved by \nany process outside the enclave itself, including   processes running at higher privilege levels.  \n \nSo, where do you begin? \n   First, you start with the Kubernetes cluster. You \ncan provision either an IBM Kubernetes Service   or Red Hat Open Shift on IBM Cloud cluster \nwith Intel SGX capable worker nodes. Next,   you install Data Shield helm chart on your \ncluster. This installs your own dedicated   single tenant Data Shield instance on your \ncluster, which includes an UI and an API.  \n   The API seamlessly aligns with your cloud \nnative strategy and integrates with your   DevOps pipelines to convert your container images \nto Intel SGX capable secure enclave counterparts,   using industry’s best Runtime Encryption \ntechnology from Fortanix! Data Shield pulls   your container image from your registry, converts \nand pushes the new image back to your registry,   without you having to make any code changes! You \ncan now update your Kubernetes deployment yaml   and deploy your new runtime memory \nencrypted application to your cluster.  And yes, Data Shield also takes the \ncomplexity away from attestation   and presents you the attestation report \nthrough a Public Key Infrastructure native to   your cluster. This gives you the additional \nlayer of technical assurance you need.  \n   The UI helps with user access management, \npresents you with the attestation reports,   gives you privileges to allow or deny a certain \nenclave, and even has an intuitive tool to convert   your application for a quick demo or a PoC. \n \nTo recap, Data Shield is a single tenant   software that runs on your Kubernetes cluster \nand helps you adopt Intel SGX secure enclaves   with technical assurance through attestation \nreports and with no code changes."
