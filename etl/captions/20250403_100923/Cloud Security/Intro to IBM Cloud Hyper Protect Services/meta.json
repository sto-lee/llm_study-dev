To address these concerns, we are talking \nabout three pillars of data security   when considering end-to-end data protection.  \nData at rest and data in flight are the two pillars that historically have received the \nmost attention and addresses many concerns. However, when regulated industries clients \nbring their sensitive workloads to the IBM Cloud   Hyper Protect Services, they want \nto process their sensitive data with   highest level of data protection without \ncompromising the performance and latency. So, to complete the data protection \nlifecycle, client wants to protect their data when it in use, or in memory.\nThis is the focus of confidential computing. The IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Services, including \nCrypto Services, Virtual Servers and DBaaS offer protection for all 3 pillars thereby providing \nan end-to-end confidential computing environment   in the IBM Cloud.\nSo, how does IBM provide this level of security?\nWell, the Hyper Protect Services leverage many years of IBM's security and\nprivacy experience to the Cloud.  To do this, we deploy our services on \nspecial LinuxONE hardware that utilizes what's known as a Secure Service Container.\nThis is a protective boundary around the base operating system, management backend \nand application interface to ensure no access by the unauthorized figures like system \nadministrators or the cloud providers.  \n   Secure Service Container ensures: \nData Integrity and self-attestation - There   is  tamper protection and verification through \nsignatures that the packaged software image is   deployed from a trusted source and not \nbeen modified since leaving the vendor.  In case any tamper is detected, \nSecure Service Container will not boot that image.  \n   There are several examples of client \nsegments from financial institutes,   automotive manufacturers to start-ups who are \ncurrently using the Hyper Protect Services   to achieve confidential computing. \nToday, we're going to explore one particular use case, the Digital Assets Platform.\nWith this use case, clients are tokenizing and trading assets, similarly to \nhow the stock market works. However, the assets aren't shares of a company, \nthey can range from coins to commodities. With our digital assets platform, \nyou have the asset itself,   that is run by a combination of 3 things.  A base technology, Blockchain, \nthat provides the ledger. The Wallets, to protect keys.\nAnd Exchanges, or the digital marketplace.  To provide a confidential computing environment \nfor the Digital Assets Platform, first,   we utilize protected runtimes with Hyper Protect \nVirtual Servers to actually run the application.  These run within a Secure Service Container that \nautomatically encrypts data and provides memory   protection to ensure that no unauthorized \nperson gets access to secure data.  Next, we work with the Hyper Protect Crypto \nServices to utilize the Hardware Security Module,   or HSM, and Key Management Service.\nWith this technology, built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4   certified hardware, clients can \nlock down their storage, backups,   Secure Service Container, and applications.\nFinally, we work with other IBM Cloud offerings to provide backup and storage, also integrated \nwith Crypto Services, and holistically   locking down the entire environment.\nIn this way, we protect from   malicious actors in several ways.\nThey cannot SSH into the boundary, the wallets and ledgers are stored in Cold Storage, or offline, \nwith encrypted communications, and the Secure   Service Container is tamper-proof and will prevent \nunauthorized access through these back doors. So, with that example in mind, there \nare 2 reasons to choose Hyper Protect   for Confidential Computing:\nFirst, clients maintain complete authority   over their workloads. They have exclusive \ncontrol of who sees the data, what happens to that data and how that data is processed.\nSecond, client data and applications are   protected from both insider and outsider \nthreats. There is technical assurance,   not just operational assurance.\nWe go beyond the confidential computing environment to protect data at all stages, in \nflight, at-rest, and in-use, plus the complete   authority that only comes with IBM Cloud.\nWith that, thank you for listening to this   brief overview of IBM Cloud Hyper \nProtect Services and their role   in the confidential computing environment.\nDo not forget to check us out at the links below."
