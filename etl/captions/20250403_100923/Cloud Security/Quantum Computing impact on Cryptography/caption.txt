Quantum computing to change everything
and it could represent a fundamental change from the way we process
information today. Plus it could enable us to understand our world in new and
different ways potentially solving previously intractable problems. So think
about the implications, right. Experts are already looking into ways quantum
computing could be used in areas like financial services, chemistry, artificial
intelligence, and like so many recent advancements in technology. Quantum
computers could change how we approach cybersecurity. We're considering how
quantum could disrupt the very basis of today's encryption methods and impact
cryptography standards, and I know it can be pretty easy to think I've got plenty
of time quantum computing is years from mature raishin, but that's only partially
true. Yes, quantum computers are in the early
stages of development, but the reality is the time to prepare was yesterday
because encrypted data stolen today could eventually be in the hands of
cyber attackers wielding more advanced quantum computers tomorrow, but
fortunately there's help. Researchers are now developing alternative methods
designed to protect data as quantum computing progresses and these new
methods could really change the way we think about an approach cybersecurity.
We're gaining these new understandings of how to apply quantum safe
cryptography to help protect systems and data against current and future attacks
it's honestly never too early to prepare companies today can start building an
understanding of the potential impact to their sensitive data and they can
educate their security teams on quantum computing and quantum safe cryptography.
Now is the time to start making your security strategy quantum ready.
