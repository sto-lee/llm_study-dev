Plus it could enable us to understand our world in new and\ndifferent ways potentially solving previously intractable problems. So think\nabout the implications, right. Experts are already looking into ways quantum\ncomputing could be used in areas like financial services, chemistry, artificial\nintelligence, and like so many recent advancements in technology. Quantum\ncomputers could change how we approach cybersecurity. We're considering how\nquantum could disrupt the very basis of today's encryption methods and impact\ncryptography standards, and I know it can be pretty easy to think I've got plenty\nof time quantum computing is years from mature raishin, but that's only partially\ntrue. Yes, quantum computers are in the early\nstages of development, but the reality is the time to prepare was yesterday\nbecause encrypted data stolen today could eventually be in the hands of\ncyber attackers wielding more advanced quantum computers tomorrow, but\nfortunately there's help. Researchers are now developing alternative methods\ndesigned to protect data as quantum computing progresses and these new\nmethods could really change the way we think about an approach cybersecurity.\nWe're gaining these new understandings of how to apply quantum safe\ncryptography to help protect systems and data against current and future attacks\nit's honestly never too early to prepare companies today can start building an\nunderstanding of the potential impact to their sensitive data and they can\neducate their security teams on quantum computing and quantum safe cryptography.\nNow is the time to start making your security strategy quantum ready."
