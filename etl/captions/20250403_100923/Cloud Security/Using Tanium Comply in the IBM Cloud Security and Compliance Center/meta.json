  "caption": "hello everyone my name is tim brander with ibm cloud today i'd like to show you how to take advantage of obtainium complies integration into ibm cloud security compliance center or sec for short what we're going to do is solve the problem of providing more complete security and compliance posture in one view using multiple tools but first a little about scc it provides you a unified single pane of glass experience for all of your secured and compliance postures it provides you continuous compliance monitoring against pre-defined profiles based on security best practices and industry compliance standards in addition it provides preventative enforcement of secure configuration of your ibm cloud services to proactively prevent misconfigurations of cloud resources and then to top it all off we provide hybrid multi-cloud support so you can scan multiple clouds as well as on-prem resources for security best practices now what is tadium titanium platform unifies security and it operation teams with a single view of critical endpoint data in real time all through a single platform and agent trust by half of the fortune 100 and largest government networks titanium provides a comprehensive and high fidelity source of truth so that organizations see every endpoint whether that be hybrid cloud containerized on-prem remote and can make informed decisions in real time ibm cloud and tanium working together was a natural partnership to allow for the best of both worlds to bring the power of our joint solutions together with this integration customers can deepen their capabilities for reducing the possibility of a breach or a security event now ibm cloud is becoming the most secure cloud provider making security and compliance easier and more secure by default tadium does a great job of discovering unknown assets in a large scale enterprise like finding an unmanaged laptop with malware or improving your patch success rate within minutes so how does integration actually work here's a diagram of what you're about to see in this video now i'm going to be playing the role of the compliance engineer that knows ibm cloud titanium and the problem we're trying to solve is seeing compliance results from ibm cloud and tanium in one dashboard okay so the first thing that i'm going to go do is uh go to cloud.ibm.com just log into my ibm cloud account now there's several ways that you can access ibm cloud security and compliance center the first way is going to be through our hamburger menu and what you're going to do is just scroll down to security and compliance it's right next to satellite and vmware the second way is through a widget that's on a pre-built dashboard for a security focal and the other way is to go up to the manage and security compliance menu item okay so now i'm just going to go click on security compliance and that brings me into the security and compliance center now the first thing i'm going to go do is click on integrations because we want to set up titanium so i'm going to go down to the titanium tile click on connect and i'm going to fill out the connection name this could be any name the registration url is just the url that you're going to be going to for your tanium instance then i'm going to click on next there's two result formats oscal or native for this instance titanium is in native so i'm going to click on native and click on connect now the result is a service id and api key that allows me to have a secure connection between tanium and security compliance center i'm going to download that and also copy it to clipboard but i'm going to be saving that to put into titanium later okay so now that i've got that done i'm going to go and click on configure and go to scopes because i need to put a place where i want all the information to go this is in our concept of scopes scopes is basically just the resources of where i want things to go i'm first going to create a scope i'm going to give it a name and click on next go to the environment scroll down to on-prem and then in the next menu item i'm going to go ahead and click on the connect third-party resources and then a new menu pops up that shows tanium there's a couple connections that i have but i'm going to just connect to the one that i just built and then click on next now in this next one we usually have a collector that is installed but in this instance tanium is the collector so we don't have to do this part so all i have to do now is just click on next and now i just review all the details that i just put in and click on create what that does is create the scope and it gives me a url that i want to point tanium at and to use that api key and service id in order to securely communicate from tanium into ibm cloud security and compliance center i'm going to copy the url and bring that over in titanium along with my api key and then finished the integration part in tanium okay that's it in this video you were able to see tanium complies integration into ibm cloud security and compliance center thanks for watching if you have any questions please add a comment below if you want to see more videos like
