one that's very timely it's been in the news a lot lately and that question is what is ransomware been in the news right between various attacks against things like the colonial pipeline attacks against local governments school systems police departments city halls public schools ransomware is everywhere in the news and the question of course is what is this ransomware thing what is it how does it matter how can i protect myself against it this is a question that needs to be on the mind of every corporate it employee in the world additionally you need to worry about it for home machines too ransomware knows no boundaries you are equally vulnerable to it on a home pc as a corporate internet is on their internet so let's talk about first what is it at its most basic the idea behind ransomware is you have a computer of some kind right and so we've got a computer we got a little monitor on it we got a little keyboard right got our keys on the keyboard and our computer is humming along right we're doing our computer things doing everything that we need to and in the operating system there are always going to be security vulnerabilities of various kinds it's just inherent to computing we are never going to find every bug the best we can do is as we find bugs we fix them but these security vulnerabilities can be exploited right there are large groups of malicious actors out there that are constantly scanning looking at code looking for these vulnerabilities looking for the ability to access systems so when one of these vulnerabilities is discovered what a malicious actor will do is they'll figure out all right first of all is this protected against if it's not protected against how can i exploit this how can i use it to make money because at the end of the day these malicious actors most of them aren't doing it for fun they're doing it to get paid so what do they do they take that vulnerability in your machine and they're going to transmit some software over the internet into the machine and that software is then going to sit dormant and idle until it gets executed and so it may have a time delay of a day a week a month whatever but there will be some sort of a time delay between when the malicious actor accesses the machine and when that code executes now what happens when the code executes the answer is that code is going to encrypt a very large proportion of the files on the machine now what is it not going to encrypt it doesn't encrypt the core operating system files because if it does the second part won't work so it's going to encrypt all of the data that's not necessary to boot the machine up and get it running so if it's a windows machine it's going to in boot it's going to encrypt everything that's not in the windows directory it's going to encrypt all of the games all the spreadsheets all of the files all of the pictures all of the everything on that machine and then it's going to pop something up on the screen that's going to say you've been hacked you've been owned your machine is compromised and the only way to get your data back is to pay a ransom that's the ransom part of ransomware to the malicious actor that has encrypted your machine that ransom is almost always paid via a cryptocurrency of some kind that has to be transferred to the attacker's wallet and so what i've just described is how it works on a consumer grade machine but frankly everyone it's exactly the same thing on a server or on a fleet of servers so again malicious actors scanning for code vulnerabilities they're looking for problems the difference being since it's not a consumer level machine they're in servers themselves so they're first looking for holes in your network security and then once they can get around your network or if they find machines that are exposed directly to the public internet then they're scanning for vulnerabilities on the machines themselves again they're looking for that exploit that nobody knows about but let's be very honest here the incidence of attacks using a zero day or a previously unknown exploit are actually really really really small the vast majority of these malicious actors are not using zero-day exploits they're using exploits that have been known sometimes they're exploits that have been known for months or years and so we're going to talk about remediation over here keep this point in mind because it's a very important one but back to our compromise system so we're over here we've got you know one or two or 10 or 15 different servers the servers have been compromised the malicious actor has spread through the network he's gotten access to a number of servers in it he's installed the ransomware and the only way to get any of that data back again is to is to pay the ransom you have to pay the guy in hopes that he will send you the decryption tool that you need in order to get your data back now as to whether or not you pay the ransom no one can answer that question for you hopefully you have sufficiently prepared yourself that you never experienced this to begin with but if you do experience it only you can answer the question do i pay this ransom or not now there are ways to avoid it and that's what we're going to talk about next so you have been owned worst case scenario now let's get into how do we keep ourselves safe all right so in order to avoid letting those malicious actors letting those hackers get access to your system the first and most important thing you can do is have good network policies it all comes down to the network this includes both your home network and any kind of an enterprise or commercial network if your network is properly set up it is configured if you are regularly installing all of the patches and all of the firmware upgrades in order to keep your network equipment up and running safely that is your first line of defense against any kind of a malicious actor getting into your machine second line of defense once you get to the physical machine itself so let's get to our you know server here you must follow proper security protocols and practices to secure your servers this is so so so important and this goes beyond just user access control although obviously user access control is incredibly important please don't ever use default passwords for anything please always use secure passwords if you must use a password use keys if at all possible a key management system is superior to a user password in every possible manner in addition to using keys you must keep your machines updated software patches hardware firmware patches are constantly being released they are protecting you against these malicious vulnerabilities and like we talked to a minute ago the majority of these bad actors are using exploits that have been known for a while if you are on the enterprise side if you are not regularly checking the cve for vulnerabilities in the systems you run on a regular basis you have got to add that to your best practice you've got to do it on a regular basis if you don't have the time or the money or the staff to do it on your own please engage with a vendor that is going to constantly be checking your systems all of the operating systems and as much of the software as you run against that cve list you have to be checking it and you have to be getting things updated just because it's annoying to take some down time to update firmware and update software on those servers doesn't mean you can annoy you can ignore it don't put it off you have to keep these things modern and current don't run old versions of operating systems and if you absolutely have to run an old version of an operating system air gap the system make it impossible to access that system from the public internet it is not safe to leave old windows machines connected to the public internet they will be compromised there's just no other way around it so please use modern hardware use modern software keep all of your security patches and your firmware patches up to date next piece let's assume that you have a malicious actor that's a little better than most and they have found a zero-day vulnerability a previously undisclosed vulnerability one that's not yet on the cve list and this is one of the more interesting topics you must back up your machines now backup restore is not the most fun thing to do on the planet as a matter of fact there's nothing fun about it but if you are not regularly testing your backups for your ability to restore from them you don't have a backup strategy you must test those backups all the time once a year is not often enough these backups are your only way to get back up and running if you've been compromised it's the only way you're going to get back up without having to pay a ransom if you're a home user the backups are how you're going to get your photos back that's i mean just frankly you're going to lose whatever has been compromised whether or not you pay that ransom in many cases because the decryption tool may not work or this particular malicious actor may not care they may just take the money and run they have no obligation to provide you with what you've paid for again they're criminals this is how they get started in the first place so have a backup strategy have a restore strategy have a good network map of all of your systems and their interconnections because if somebody can compromise one server they can probably compromise multiples and so let's imagine here our enterprise network right so we've got server here one and we've got you know an active directory server over here and we've got servers you know three four five six seven whatever so on and so forth everything is all interconnected right active directory is going to get all of the controls let's say that the server that gets compromised is your active directory server this is kind of like worst case scenario stuff here once they're into your active directory server if they can get some credentials they can start getting into everything else that you have running in your environment they're going to compromise everything and so once they have compromised it once they have encrypted everything they've sent you their ransom message you then have to make the decision all right are we going to try to restore from a backup well remember at the beginning when i said that the malicious actor they were going to install code but they weren't going to trigger it yet do you know when you were compromised because you have to restore to a backup that exists before you were compromised because if you restore a backup your backup strategy is great you've got good systems images you can bring everything back from a backup from last week but oh wait you were compromised six weeks ago all you're going to do is you're going to restore good backup copies that still have the malicious code in them and if that's the case do you have the ability to find that malicious code and eliminate it before it activates itself again otherwise you're going to find yourself in exactly the same spot no access to systems no ability to process workloads no ability to run applications you are down so that is what ransomware is these are some ways to protect against it please please please i implore you learn about ransomware learn how to protect yourself against it engage companies that have expertise you know folks that know a lot about the cve folks that know a lot about network security that know about secure server security engage with your operating system vendors to be sure that you're on a regular patch and maintenance cycle to be sure that you are protecting yourself against these kinds of attacks hopefully you found the information today valuable if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comments and we'll talk to you later thank you so much for stopping by the channel today if you have any
