number and then once you tell them your actual problem they transfer you to another agent who then asks you the same exact questions can you give me your name date of birth account number like if that first conversation had never really happened well this is an example of poor data governance and highlights how the inefficient sharing of data and permissions in a company can have an impact on you as a customer so let's take a look at that customer service example and put it in the context of a bank and think about how that information got into the hands of the customer service agent in the first place and it all starts with a central repository for data and this central repository has all different types of data flowing into it from the website or the mobile app where you as the customer fill out information so from the central repository we can have different types of information being filled out by you as a customer some of it can be non-confidential like your name or your address while some of it can be confidential information that you don't want shared like your social security number or your account number data governance is about protecting this information because it doesn't just stay here it flows to other departments so going back to that example it can flow to the customer service department or the marketing department or the loans department and so on so going back to data governance it's about allowing the sharing of this information from that central repository to different departments without exposing important information from you as a customer and one of the ways that we can do this in an automated fashion is through a data governance framework this framework has three main components the first being a policy the second being rules to implement this policy and then the third component being classification of these rules so let's break down each of these pieces through this customer service example the first being the policy right if this was a bank they would either have an internal data protection policy they're trying to put in place or be following a national guideline like gdpr and this data policy can then be further broken down into rules specific rules that make this policy whole and the two main types of rules are data protection rules which you may have heard about and governance rules so data protection rules pertain to a specific type of data asset so going back to this example here you could set a data protection rule specifically tied to social security numbers and censor how it moves throughout an organization on the other hand you can use a governance rule and set it up as a written description of how to handle data so i could write up a paragraph explaining how the customer service department uses this data or the marketing department or the loans so once you have these rules in place you then want to classify the data that's flowing into the organization and two ways to classify this data are through business terms or data classes and they can work together but just to break them apart here let's talk about business terms business terms can be thought of as the language through which data is interpreted in your organization so let's say we want to understand utilization rate for our mobile app for each of these departments but utilization rate is being measured by months in customer service and then days in marketing and loans so what we can do is set up a business term and call it util for utilization rate and describe how it's measured so i can say utilization rate is measured in days throughout each of these departments and in that way i standardize how that data asset is measured between departments now the other way to measure these data sources and data assets is through data classes and we can understand data classes through metadata and metadata tells you a summary of what's inside of a data source so let's say i'm putting in a bunch of spreadsheets into my bank and i want to understand what's in these spreadsheets without actually opening them well the meta the metadata of this spreadsheet would tell me how many rows it has how many columns it has and when it was made and it can also specifically tell me what's inside of that row by title so i can understand if there's an account number in that row and center that account number throughout the movement of that document throughout the organization so with this framework in place with the right policy rules and classification in place i have the base of my framework that can be automated through reference data which is another word for code that i can implement throughout this architecture and automate the movement of data throughout but ultimately we want to tie it back to the customer service example that i talked about earlier so if i had my customer service agent accessing the same information but i had a data framework in place i could set a policy for that customer service agent to follow that breaks down specific rules of that data protection movement or of that data asset movement and further classify that data asset so the right customer service agent has the right data at the right time without exposing account numbers or social security numbers throughout but ultimately this is just one example of data governance and there's a lot of different examples that may apply to your organization so feel free to leave a comment below and we can answer how data governance applies in that example another way data governance is implemented is through data fabric so if you're interested in data fabric and how it can operationalize this framework throughout your organization check out some of our videos and overall if you're interested in technology feel
