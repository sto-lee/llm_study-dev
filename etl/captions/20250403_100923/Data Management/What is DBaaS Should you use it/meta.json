that stands for database as a service that's our dnrb here literally stanford database what is database as a service so if we think about our cloud model of as a service products and as a service offerings and if you've got any questions about that we've got a bunch of other videos on the channel that you can review to learn about that as a service model dbas is the ability to deliver a database in that as a service model and so if you think about the traditional way to deploy a database right is you'd go over here and you'd order some sort of a server and on top of that server you'd put linux and then on top of that linux you would install your database software right so my sequel and so there's a lot of work involved in this right you have to go out you order the server configure the server put your linux on it whatever it may be download compile and install your database software there's a lot that goes on into this now you can script it you can make it faster you can make it easier but there's still a lot to get it set up but getting it set up isn't the hard part once it's set up you've got to keep it running and that's where the real challenge comes in right because what do you have to worry about when you have all of these things well you've got to worry about your users right and so with all of the users who can log into the server who can log into the operating system who can log into the database what kind of access levels do they need what kind of permissions do they need you've got to worry about patching hardware patching firmware patching software patching for the operating system software patching for your database you have to have somebody who keeps up with all of those patches protecting against security vulnerabilities you've got to think about your access control model who can get into this why and when do you have separation of duties between your database administrators and your server administrators or can people cross-pollinate there's a lot of work that goes into successful operation of a database server particularly something that's going to be hosting a production workload you've got to build it you've got to secure it and oh hey by the way you've got to operate it and what does that mean what do i mean when i say you've got to operate it well so you've got these three components here that you also have to have backup what happens if the server goes down you've got to have backups of it you've got to have quiest versions of the database you're going to have backups of your operating system all of your configuration if the server goes down you need to restore from those backups you need to bring it back up live again and there's a lot of work that goes into all of that hence database is a service so what happens well the whole idea behind database as a service is instead of you doing all of this work we the cloud provider are going to do most of this for you and so you're going to come to us and rather than ordering the server and telling us what operating system and what version of database software and all that you want you're going to say hey bradley i want my sql database as a service i want an ms and my sql database that i can just log into and start using and it's going to have connections on it you're going to open some ports up for me so that it can work for a web server or another application server and i just want to interact with it in an as a service manner i don't want to worry about backups you take care of that i don't want to worry about running it highly available you take care of that i don't want to worry about it crashing and me having to restore it you guys take care of all of that what i want is a database that has connections for user sessions that has connections for app server sessions and then it has connections for admin admin services and i don't want to worry about backups and all of those kinds of things the cloud provider takes care of all of that that is the as a service part and so on the back end to the cloud provider that you are buying this database serve this database as a service product from they're going to take care of the hardware the operating system the patching the user access the security the backups running it highly available guaranteeing that it's always up always available they are going to take care of all of those things for you you're just going to subscribe to this service as a service right you're going to pay an amount per month and that amount is going to be built up of how many rights do you make the database how big is the database how much storage space does it take up what level of availability do you want does it have to be available with three nines or four nines or five nines of uptime and then some other little little add-ons but it allows you to tailor your spend to where you are only spending what you need to run your workload and so when it's pitched like this of course everybody comes back and they say oh man that sounds great why wouldn't everybody only buy database as a service why would anybody go out and ever stand up their own database ever again this is a good question and let's talk about that for a minute because the big difference between database as a service and running it yourself is that in a database as a service model a lot of the administrative control the very specific tweaking and tuning that you can do on a database to make it run faster that gets abstracted away from you the person who are consuming it because it's run by the cloud provider and so if we think about our two models right our as a service model versus our role your own model enroll your own which is where you set up everything yourself you have a hundred percent administrative control over everything you decide what users get access you decide what your backup strategy is what your restore strategy is you decide everything on your own and like in spider-man with great power comes great responsibility now in that as a service model cloud provider is going to make a bunch of those decisions for you makes your life easier but you can't get in and twist all of those dials and knobs and tune that database so that it runs at 100 performance all the time specific to your workload and so you may end up having to oversize your database as a service from a performance perspective as compared if you rolled your own but that's okay because if you don't want to go out and hire your own database administrators and hire your own server administrators and deal with the headaches of user access and security and integration you don't have to you can consume it in an as a service model you don't need to worry about cloud providers going to take care of that all you worry about is plugging your endpoints in to where they need to be and being sure that the right people have the credentials and everything else is going to get taken care of for you so that you can focus on what you really want to do which is running that workload in providing the service out to your customers your partners and your consumers thank you so much for your time today
