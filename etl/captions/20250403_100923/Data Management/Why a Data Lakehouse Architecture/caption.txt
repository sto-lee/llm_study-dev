in a previous video we talked about the data lake house concept and shared a story about how data lake houses are much like the operations of a commercial kitchen in a restaurant so definitely check out that video If you haven't seen it today I'd like to discuss more about the key drivers for and values delivered by an open data lake house architecture as well as share a couple examples and help me do that I'm very excited to invite Edward calisburt director of product management for IBM databases to join us Edward thanks for being here hey love so Edward let's start with the major macro trends that we're seeing and that are leading organizations to modernize their Analytics infrastructures how has the use of data shifted drastically in the past couple years well of there are three major macro trends that we're seeing in the market first the amount and the cost of data is exploding second data consumption patterns are expanding and changing and third data architecture is being disrupted and transformed so could you speak briefly about each of these sure so there's no doubt that the amount of data is expanding rapidly but also it's coming from a variety of different sources and in all sorts of new data formats what this means is that to manage all of this data Enterprises are spending more money and some estimate that that is in the range of 30 percent year over year okay so when you talk about the cost of data are you just referring to the cost of storing it in different repositories like data Lakes warehouses or other stores or are you also referring to the cost of managing and governing the life cycle of that data well it's actually both let's talk about the patterns of data consumption there's an ever increasing demand for the use of data especially from business users there's no doubt that Analytics has become an essential component of almost every job and certainly AI the use of AI is expanding rapidly now this doesn't mean that every business user needs to become an AI expert but it does mean that more and more we're seeing AI being used to automate and optimize certain decisions at scale such as advertising campaigns or supply chain Networks AI is also being used to augment human in the loop decision making such as credit risk underwriting this means Enterprises are always looking for more data and use it to drive new insights right and and you know what about the data privacy and data regulatory concerns that are around AI sure when you combine this with increasing regulatory standards Enterprises will require higher levels of built-in data security and governance in order to enable this data sharing and consumption absolutely and you know another thing that we hear a lot is the democratization of data so it's about create it's about time to Value right business users yes they need data but they need it like yesterday right it doesn't do the user or the organization a lot of benefit if it takes long complicated processes for users to get access to that data so to get the most value out of the data it's got to be consumed as quickly as possible and all while still adhering to those governance and compliance policies would you agree with that absolutely that leads us to our third point which is architecture organizations are realizing that the way the data is managed needs to change the emergence of commodity Cloud object storage and the adoption of open data formats is really allowing Enterprises to increase the return on investment in data management and they're doing this through the optimization of the price performance of their workloads across different storage and compute tiers now what does that mean it means that organizations can benefit from having the right tool for the right job at the right cost instead of defaulting into a data warehouse which may be appropriate in some cases but can also become very expensive and ineffective in others right so what I'm hearing is more data more users and more uses of that data right and all while still better ways to share and manage access around it right um so Edward how are these aspects related to the key values that are delivered by an open data lake house architecture great question love we see three key values that are delivered by an open data Lake as architecture first an open data lake house provides the foundation for users to easily and cost effectively access store manage and unify large amounts of data and from different sources and in different formats second an open data lake house can be easy to deploy within existing environments providing users fast access to more data without having long procurement onboarding or data pipelining and wrangling processes making it much easier to consume and third open data lake houses can optimize your analytics workloads to run where they perform the best and are most cost efficient all this part of an integrated architecture wow so you know I've noticed one thing you've said the word open a lot can you explain to us what the difference is there sure I'm glad you wrote that up a lake house should leverage the capabilities across existing data and analytics environments if you already have data and analytics workloads in a data warehouse or in a Hadoop data Lake that's okay you shouldn't be forced to migrate or rip and replace that environment in order to get started with the lake house but what about new data and new workloads well a lake house should be the starting point for new data and new workloads as well as provide a modernization path for existing environments over time you know the other thing that we hear often is customers getting stuck with one vendor well also open also means that you're always in control of your data and you aren't forced into proprietary data formats or specialized Tooling in order to use it it also means that you can maximize the use of your data without having to make copies of it and move it around and this provides for lower costs higher productivity and better governance which ultimately leads to what Enterprises are looking for which is more trusted decisions wow so Edward what I'm hearing is a data lake house is like a network of highways some of them have tolls on them and some of them don't like regular freeways and a lake house allows you to go on the toll road pay when you need to get somewhere really fast but when you're not in a hurry and there's no traffic take the regular Highway love that's a great analogy think about using a data lake house to cut your data warehousing costs by up to half by optimizing the price performance of your analytic workloads or like you're saying saving money by driving on the freeway while there's no traffic and you're not in a hurry wow Edward that sounds really exciting let's hit the road let's do it thank you if you like this video and want to see more like it please like And subscribe if you have questions please drop
