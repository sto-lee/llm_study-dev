[Music] primary business of hos Arthur's advertising implementation so when a brand goes for a big global market we take the original creative idea and we translate it into 30 or 40 languages as arthur sparta w PP w PP contains multiple large global creative agencies and the idea was to connect all the WPP creative agencies and their studios into the Hogarth network so that we could work units of acetals way if you think about 1/32 TV commercials we probably make 300 versions so there's a massive pressure on our production storage to hold this stuff so we need a really efficient way of uploading into some sort of archival value and I think we're now running about five petabytes so it is important to have an archiving system that's responsive and quick that allows you to retrieve the material quickly but also allows you to retrieve just the bits that you want those constraints meant that we really need to look for some sort of disk based archiving system clevis a starfruit being really cost-effective and and really quick and actually the really important part is distributed sort of single namespace for storage so you could physically distribute the closet elements into multiple data centers but make holding periods as one storage pool that anybody can access in fact we just bought a whole bunch more that were safe out of like a few weeks ago and we're currently installing I think another 1.7 petabytes of the stuff and you know the company's been really responsive and bringing people to help us install that making sure the configurations correct the system actually has never gone wrong
