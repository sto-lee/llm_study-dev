Their prevalence across \nenterprises has grown significantly   over the past 20+ years. But with \nmultiple modern advancements,   the numerous options out there \nare now much more complex.  \n \n  So, let's talk about what an enterprise data \nwarehouse, or \"EDW\", is. So, first and foremost,   there's often confusion between \"data lakes\" \nand \"data warehouses\" and even \"data marts\".   So, I like to think of a data warehouse as being \nmore purpose-specific than a data lake. So,   while a data lake is a great place to dump all \nsorts of raw, structured and unstructured data   in a quick way to clean and organize later, a \ndata warehouse, on the other hand, is a large   collection of organized and clean business data, \nready to help an organization make decisions.   And a data mart is like a subset of a \ndata warehouse that's more specific to a   particular business domain. So, for example, \nyou could have a finance data mart.  \n \n  But for today, let's focus on the data warehouse.   So, we'll get rid of data lakes and data marts, \nand we'll make this a little bit bigger.  \n \n  But for today, we'll focus on the data warehouse. \nSo, let's get rid of data lakes and data marts,   and make our data warehouse \na little bit bigger.  \n \n  So, the data warehouse serves as the single source \nof truth for an organization across multiple   knowledge domains. And data in the warehouse \ncomes from multiple different source systems.   And is transformed from raw \ndata to high quality data,   optimized for analytics via various different \nETL, or \"Extract, Transform and Load\" tools.  \n \n  So, as I mentioned, data that's \nin our source systems can be in   different types. It could be transactional \nsystems, it can be relational databases,   and they can cover a wide \nvariety of business domains.  \n \n  So, the data could cover things like customer \ndata from our CRMs. We could have sales data.   We could have data from our ERP systems. \nWe could even have supply chain data.   And the list goes on and on. Right.  \n \n  So, once data has been cleaned, transformed and   loaded into our data warehouse, it's \nnow ready for us to expose to our users,   who can then start to take it and do analytics \nand machine learning on these data sets.  \n \n  So, who are our users? Our users can be folks \nlike business analysts. We can have data   scientists. We could even have data engineers. And \nthese folks can now start leveraging these data   sets, either using the built-in analytics tools in \nthe data warehouse or using a variety of different   business intelligence or predictive \nanalytics and machine learning platforms.  \n \n  OK, so now that we know what an \nenterprise data warehouse is,   let's talk about the different ways \nin which it can be implemented.   So, three common ways in which a \ndata warehouse can be deployed.  \n \n  The first way is on-premises. Now, \na couple different ways in which an   on-prem data warehouse can be configured, \nwe could have our data warehouse running on   commodity hardware. Now, this could be set up \nand structured using either MPP, or \"Massively   Parallel Processing\", architecture where we just \nadd more compute nodes as our workload grows,   or using SMP, or \"Symmetric Multi-Processing\", \narchitecture where, typically, we have a   tightly coupled, multi-CPU system that shares \nresources from one common operating system.  \n \n  Now, the other way is through a \npurpose-built appliance format.   Now, this is typically an integrated \nstack of CPU, memory storage software,   all purpose-built and optimized for a data \nwarehouse workload from a single vendor.  \n \n  So, what are some of the benefits \nof having an on-prem data warehouse?   Well, first you get to maintain complete \ncontrol over the entire tech stack, right?   Second, you can leverage your local network \nspeeds and perhaps avoid some bandwidth challenges   typically associated with the cloud. You can also \nleverage high availability, and we can maintain   strict governance and regulatory compliance, but \non the other hand, an on-prem data warehouse does   come with an upfront investment and the \nneed for ongoing support and maintenance. Now, the other way in which a \ndata warehouse can be deployed   is through a cloud-based data warehouse, \nwhere our data warehouse is delivered as   a managed to SaaS offering via the \nmultiple public cloud providers.  \n \n  So, moving data warehouses to the cloud is \nthe next frontier for a lot of enterprises   and for valid reasons. Some of the benefits \ninclude being able to free up resources   to focus on other high value analytics tasks, \nright, instead of just managing systems.  \n \n  Another benefit can also be the \nability to scale easily. Right,   because we don't have to go \nout and procure new hardware   and we get to leverage automatic upgrades. Right. \nNow, on the other hand, oftentimes a cloud-based   data warehouse can take a performance hit due to \nhow it's fine tuned for that specific workload,   and there can be some unanticipated high costs \ndue to how cloud data warehouse is scaled.  \n \n  OK, the third option is actually a hybrid \napproach. So, this takes the best of on-prem   and cloud and brings them together. And a lot \nof enterprises choose to run both their on-prem   and cloud data warehouses in conjunction. And this \ncan be done for a couple of different reasons.  \n \n  So, one benefit can be that this allows us to \nexplore new use-cases. Right. So as an enterprise,   we may have certain data sources that \nwere born in the cloud. So, it can be   beneficial to start leveraging a cloud data \nwarehouse for analytics against those use-cases   while still maintaining their mission \ncritical workloads on-prem.  \n \n  Another benefit can be for a disaster \nrecovery and backup scenario.   This is where we would use both our environments \nin conjunction for DR and backup reasons.  \n \n  So, if we take a step back, we can see that \nwe've barely started to scratch the surface of   enterprise data warehouses and how they fit into \nan overall enterprise architecture. But I hope   this video has given us a good idea of how data \nwarehouses fit in and what they're used for. Thank   you. If you have any questions, please drop us a \nline below.
