everybody is talking about generative AI but gen AI is a subset of the larger field of machine learning and I'm going to give you 10 use cases of how machine learning or ml is used today in everyday life and by Machine learning I'm talking about these sub field of artificial intelligence in which machines learn from data sets and past experiences by recognizing patterns and generating predictions now now machine learning is projected to become a $200 billion industry by 2029 but it's already very much here today so let's get into it now one aspect of machine learning that's seen huge utility is NLP or natural language processing that's the ability for machines to make sense of the unstructured mess that we like to call human language so use case number one is customer service text based queries can be handled by chatbots which act as virtual agents that many businesses provide on their e-commerce sites the chatbots can resolve many queries themselves and where they can't they can routes customers to where they can find the appropriate help from a human customer service representative ml also Powers voice assistance things like Siri and Alexa where first speech to text and then NLP machine learning models help understand a spoken command that same capability is used by services like slack and YouTube to power Auto transcription of spoken words in video content now number three is ML and mobile apps where would we be without spotify's ml models for generating song recommendations or linkedin's use of ml to make employment suggestions your phone is likely filled with apps that call out to Services running machine learning models and actually ml in smartphones really deserves its own category because with the power of modern smartphones some of that machine learning is performed directly on the device such as computational photography to generate background blur and your selfie shots or unlocking your phone with facial recognition or onboard device image classification models that help you to search your photo library like that time I was trying to find this picture of my cat where he jumped into the dryer ml helped me to find that without me spending a ton of time scrolling through my photos app hey the dry wasn't actually on now now that's an example of a needle in a hyack problem thousands of images and there's only one I'm looking for which in a way is is similar to use case number five that is financial transactions now in the us alone there are 150 million credit card transactions every day and the vast majority of those are legitimate how to detect the fraudulent ones well ML and deep learning are widely used in fraud detection where financial institutions train ml models and classification algorithms to rec ize suspicious online transactions and flag them for further investigation 150 million credit card transactions every day is 1,739 every second so this is a task that would be near impossible to perform manually well did you also know that between 60 and 73% of all Stock Market trading is conducted by ml algorithms and that percentage is increasing every year all right let's quickly knock out a couple more so ml is used frequently in cyber security reinforcement learning uses ml to train models to identify and respond to cyber attacks and detect intrusions ml informs a lot of our transportation these days for instance Google Maps uses ml algorithms to check current traffic conditions and determine the fastest route and right sharing apps like uber and lift use ml to match Riders to the drivers and ml plays a large role in filtering email messages as well through classification of incoming messages and autocomplete responses now number nine that's Health Care this is one example where machine learning can help augment and speed up human capabilities now it's estimated that doctors evaluating mammograms Miss between 30 to 40% of cancers and the rate of false positives is even higher ml is already helping here where pattern recognition models are trained to classify tumors that are hard to see with a human eye this is increasing not only the accuracy of interpreting Radiology Imaging but it's also increasing the reading time of Radiologists allowing them to focus their attention on the more suspicious examinations flagged by the ml models there are also ml successes in early lung cancer screening and finding bone fractures okay one last one and and a question for you in general which department in an organization uses Ai and machine learning the most well according to Forbes it is the marketing and sales department marketers use ml for lead generation data analytics and search engine optimization and they often build on top of existing ml models so for example consider how recommendation algorithms like those at net nflix make TV and movie suggestions as to what to watch next based on your derived tastes and interests well the marketing and sales department can use those same ml models for targeted personalized marketing campaigns tailored to those very same tastes and interests look we we hear so much these days about the future of AI and in particular a GI artificial general intelligence that will one day match and surpass the intelligence of humans but but right now that level of AI doesn't exist it's theoretical but machine learning that's AI that is already here and it really is very much part of our everyday lives if you have any questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like And
