hello today we will be talking about the edge computing in space on the international space station for the dna sequencing my name is naim i'm ibm's cto for space tech let's talk about edge computing what is such computing ash computing is about taking the compute and storage where the data is being produced so we can reduce the latency and reduce the movement of data from point a to point b let's first talk about the international space station international space station is above earth in the leo which is called the lower earth orbit around 250 miles above it travels around 17 500 miles per hour and it can circle every 90 minutes the way it communicates there are satellites in the geostationary orbit it's a constellation of these satellites from where it relays information back to the ground stations on the earth and the data goes into data centers that's all the mechanism of how the uplink and downlink works now let's talk about the dna sequencing so what is the dna dna serves as a blueprint for an organism dna sequencing is about finding the characteristics of this organism it can be very beneficial for monitoring the astronauts health or looking for infectious disease on the space station the way to date works the astronauts on the space station they are scheduled to take a sample from the surface and run through this portable dna sequencer device it's a physical device which is attached to a laptop once the run is done it generates raw data which can be several hundred gigabytes today this data comes down via the satellites on the ground for processing and this whole process takes some time in our collaboration with hpe who sent their sbc2 systems space point community systems in our partnership with them we determined that we can do the processing of all of this raw data which is being produced instead of bringing that information down to the earth we can just do all the processing we utilized ibm cloud and we built the open source code using running it on the red hat crc which is code ready container openshift platform basically it's a set of container containers code which we built this code was pushed to nasa and then nasa pushed this code up to the space station onto the spc2 computers now this solution has several steps because it's a sequential process it has to go and process all this information so the first thing the containers when they come up on the crc platform they go through a step called base calling then the next step is demultiplexing the third step is the alignment the fourth step is the analysis and the last step is actually generating the report this whole process can take up to six to eight hours and at the end of the day it generates a file which is less than one one megabyte so as you can see is in this edge computing use case where we were initially moving hundreds of gigs of data back to the ground and processing and taking time in this case literally in a day within six to eight hours we can create the file the file is less than one meg and we can send down to the earth that's the resulting file which the scientists are looking for and thus reducing the time latency preserving the bandwidth which is very critical at the space station communications between because there are many projects happening so as we said this is an extreme uh use case for the edge computing now think about this as we are moving forward going back to the moon as part of rtms program mars and beyond if we use this edge computing mechanisms point devices as we are heading towards the deeper space we might be able to detect possibly life beyond earth thank you
