[Music] Scarah is a software development company that is the based here in Emeryville California and we're devoted to solving the problems of data transfer particularly as they pertain to large data and wide area networks we make a software technology that we invented here called espera fast that is a new protocol for data communication particularly focusing on speed and efficiency of moving large data over wide area IP networks and we create software products that utilize that technology for users in all types of applications that move files in it the espera fast protocol can move data as fast as your network infrastructure will allow it can be sometimes up to 100 or 200 times faster we realized that if we wanted to make a significant and life-changing impact on the industry's transition to digital media we needed to move at its pace once the adoption of our technology started we enter at technology tornado we really have to step up our development and our technology integration and at the same time our film and broadcast users started driving a lot of aspects of our products which in the end became the second and then the third generation of experts fast technology Netflix has been transcoding video for a very long time in the Amazon Cloud was felt like that was the place to be the most innovative and be able to scale our business our global aspect of our business and so we reached a point eventually though where the ingested video was the bottleneck for that effort because we were hopping that video through our old data center infrastructure where we go along no longer want to spend capital on upgrading the network upgrading the storage and so we approached aspera with the idea of a project to ingest the video directly into the Amazon Cloud using their product and they were very happy approachable to Co pioneer that effort with us and so now we're at the point where the large video file ingestion we do from the studios lands directly in the Amazon Cloud and when it touch it down it's encrypted it's secure it's durable and we're very happy with how this project turned out with us we've been using aspera since it became a company at the time we needed a way to move content around the world in a much faster way than the current technology at that time we found espera as in the back of nab with just a few people manning their booth we took a look at it and decided that we'd give it a try we installed it it's worked since day one and since then it has become a critical part of all of our digital workflows here at the studio we joke around here that we use a spare as a verb people say can us spare that to me I've always said that once your company name is a verb you've made it espera has definitely made it we could not do the things that we do without their technology
