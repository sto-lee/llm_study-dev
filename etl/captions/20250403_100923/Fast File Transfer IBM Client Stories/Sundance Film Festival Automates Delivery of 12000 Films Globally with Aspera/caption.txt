[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so the Sundance Film Festival takes place in January every year usually towards the end of the month it's ten days long we see about 45,000 attendees supporting them or 2,000 volunteers and our staff of about 300 people we've got 22 screens our furthest north and our furthest south venues are 150 miles apart from each other because Sundance is based in a small mountain town we have to come and build out a lot of what large cities would already have in place we're bringing in networks computers workstations everything's temporary so just five years ago the majority of films shown at the Sundance Film Festival were 35-millimeter the majority of everything that we have is now a digital file very rapidly we saw shift from thirty five-millimeter to DCP a DCP file on average is about 90 to 100 gigs of information if you're taking the 160 films that we have and multiplying that out by two copies you're looking at like 28 29 thousand gigabytes of information and that's now creating demand on our network it's create a Mandan storage that we hadn't previously dealt with just the logistics around that and the challenges of efficiently moving big packets of information around you don't have ten hours to wait for a file to download so we have a couple problems begin to solve one is that receiving large files so receiving those from post-production houses or from filmmakers a little bit trickier is now how do we take that DCP file and move it to one of our venues and so using a spare effects and a spare cargo we're moving these DCP files between our warehouse and individual theaters from our research it was the product on the market they best suited our needs it actually has been sort of a watershed moment for us to we're like yeah we can do this now that we've seen that we can move a file from our central storage to an individual theater using a spare cargo aspects we want to roll that out to all of our cinemas and theaters and really automate that workflow I feel that kind of a driving force and just trying to figure out ways that I can make us a more efficient you know operation I see a spare the as a way for us to create a completely digital workflow for accepting GCP files for getting those files and for moving them between theatres I don't have the bandwidth to worry about the logistics of whether a product is working that's why I choose what I know I can depend on and it's like it do the work I think we can we can get to the point that even with the temporary nature of the festival that we have a fully automated workflow that allows us to put resources on ensuring that every single screening goes off without a hitch unless on just moving a file and driving a print from location to location the successful festival for me is a happy filmmakers a happy audience and no one knows that I exist I want to be The Wizard of Oz behind the wall and have a perfect show that's a successful you you
