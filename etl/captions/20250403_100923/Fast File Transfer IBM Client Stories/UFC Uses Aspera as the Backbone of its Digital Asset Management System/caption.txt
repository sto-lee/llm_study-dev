you and [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're a live combat sort of promotion we have multiple events all over the world we have a pretty small staff and it's very mobile staff we have to travel everywhere pretty much everything we do requires that we're in a venue in a hotel in a conference center we produce pay-per-view events and then everything kind of spiders out from that a lot of it the interest based media and content for the fans production-wise on any given week we could be creating four five post produced shows along with promo videos for upcoming fights acerra is the back end of our digital asset management system so even internally between our LA and Las Vegas offices so guys no video back and forth gigabytes of video back and forth all the time we drop a sixty foot office trailer and do a lot of our operations on-site because we have so much content that rolls into the broadcast we have a team on the ground that actually goes behind the scenes they're pulling content in we have people editing it and we're pushing it out in a matter of hours the way we move video around in relation to our live event is through a relatively new tapeless workflow over the last year we have completely changed our workflow to espera delivery one of the things that espera has allowed us to do is take a very small team of people and create a tremendous amount of content and distribute it over a wide variety of partners our editors are using that system but also our distribution folks are using that same system to pop video in and out all the time mostly outs we distribute massive quantities of video every day we used to deliver 90% of our content on tape just a year and a half ago now it's completely reversed we deliver about 95% of our content by espera we've been able to get a lot of our partners to come over to the digital realm as well once they saw the the benefit of it they were soon telling us never to safe anymore right now we currently have over 200 espero clients Matt's push clients pull clients most folks don't even know the despair is back there behind our asset management system or behind our web distribution system it's not something that we have to have our creative minds spend time on worrying about what kind of delivery affair is putting there in the background it's reliable it's easy you know it's a single button solution we could not live two days without aspera it would just it would kill us it would totally kill it it would totally hang come so a spare is vitally important to my workflow and my distribution team because I have a core very small core set of people just allowed to push out exponentially more content to different partners efficiently quickly and nimbly and be more responsive which i think is crucial to promoting our court and growing our brands there's no way we could have done this earlier in our life distribute this kind of material as broadly as we do we just couldn't have done it without the ability to deliver video as quickly as asparagus [Music]
