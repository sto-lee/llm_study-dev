hello my name is l I'm a smarter process offering manager at IBM today I'm going to give you a demonstration of IBM operational decision manager on cloud before starting the demonstration I want to give you a short introduction of what uh IBM odm oncloud is first of all IBM operational L manager oncloud is a collaborative software as a Serv that is RO based and the the aim of odm oncloud is to help you to capture automate and manage all your frequently occurring business decision that are Ru based then you will be able to share them across the cloud IBM odm on cloud is a Sofer service Cloud that is hosted on the IBM Cloud platform based on soft layer this means that this service is available on the 17 different uh IBM softlayer data center worldwide the concept of operation of odm oncloud is very simple everything start from the rule designer is the eclipse environment for developers that have uh the responsibility of Designing the decision service configuring the decision service defining all the models uh the vocabulary the business user will use and the various deployment configuration and then the service is pushed to the cloud then everything will happen from the cloud so the business Expert in charge of maintaining the business policies will have access to all the rules they they are able to update them view them test them s do some simulation Define their own testing and simulation suits and uh validating all the change Odon Cloud also provid some uh predefined governance uh services with the decision governance framework that comes out of the box with the service aium Cloud comes with three uh different uh environments development test and production as we will see the release manager is in charge of pushing the various versions of the decisions depending on the updates and in depending of the life cycle they are in into one of these uh different um environments we will see the three Dev test and production environment in the demonstration finally uh the uh external application will invoke this decision service providing the the input data and then getting in as a result the decisions all the connections from outside to the clouds are secured and performed through https with odm on cloud you can Define as many uh different decisions as you were used to do with uh the odm on Prime you can do some fraud detection underwriting claims eligibility pricing loyalty so all the classical rules-based decisions uh that you were used to develop with the odm on Prem are also uh available and and you can Al develop similar uh decisions from IBM odm on cloud in today's demonstration we are going to see a simple fast loan uh decision service so from a fast loan web application any customer are able to provide their data to get uh a loan from the the bank the fast loan decision servic is hosted on odm on cloud and provides different Services validation scoring and then eligibility to the loan the relas manager in our demonstration will be responsible for updating the business policies and and pushing them into the various death test and prod environments dep depending on where we are in the update life cycle so let's now move to the demonstration so before having a look to odm on clouds let's see this client application so from this application any customer can provide their data that their name age all these data that the rules will use to decide about the validation about the scoring and the eligibility to the loan behind the scene we are going to use the Odon Cloud uh invocation to the service from this sample interface we can decide to invoke the rules from the dev the test or the production environment as any https uh connection so we have to provide the uh credential so the username and the password to be able to access uh the the the cloud instance that is here uh located here in that URL so let's use uh with this data this decision service so here uh I have submitted the data to the service and automatically uh I see that my loan has been rejected I can see some reasons so I can see the score that has been computed by the rules and one reason the de to income was too high compared to the credit score I got with my data if I just change a value here for example in increasing my yearly income and invoke a new uh uh decision here the result is different because now I am eligible with my dep to income ratio that is good for the optain score so all the score and decisions are managed behind the scene by the uh business schules decision service so let's see what's behind the scene so let's first log in into Odon Cloud so here I can provide my credentials and then my password and now I enter Odon Cloud so this is the landing page of Odon Cloud so as I've explained previously you can see that odm cloud is composed of three environments the development environment in which you will see uh the rule designer the decision uh Center business console Enterprise consol that are the two consoles that are designed for business user to update manage uh their business policies and the rule execution uh server console that provides a visibility on the dedicated execution server instance that is uh available on this development environment then we have a test environment where we will just have the rule execution server console to manage all the decisions that are deployed on the test environment and finally the pro prodction environment once again with the rule execution server console allowing me to see all the decision that have been deployed in the production environment so in the previous example with the uh with the small demo that we have seen we were executing the decision from that environment the production one so any uh as I said in the introduction U odm oncloud is a world based service this means that here I'm logged as a an administrator this means that I can see all the administration panel and have access to all the users and privileges from the users that are here in the in this instance I can rapidly invite a new user just by here setting a an email and then automatically odm oncloud will send an invitation email to this user uh allowing him first to set up his account his name and and password and then finally access the uh the cloud instance so from from this uh uh from this interface so you can filter here so you can see here my profile I'm an administrator and here I am uh my role is a release manager that is the highest role uh with the highest privileges that you can have in odm on cloud so in just one click you can change the the roles of the users uh and that will give them access to some specific functions and features of the product or just block them for example deploying the production environment is something that is just allowed for release managers as I am right now let's come back now to the to the to the decision service so as I said so everything start from the rule designer so from this environment you can download the rule designer archive that and and you will get the entire config preconfigured Eclipse environment that allows any developer to set up the decision service before pushing it to the cloud let's have a look to this environment rapidly so here we are into the eclipse environment we are in the rule perspective and we can see here our decision service the first L service demo with the eligibility scoring uh and and validation rule set that uh that that are composing here our Global decision we can see here the rule flow that uh orchestrate these various uh uh rule uh rule sets one important aspect of uh of uh a decision service is the deployment configurations so here we have defined two uh configuration one that will allow a a user to De deploy a non production environment and here we can see all the servers that are available on the C on the cloud uh and that are non- production environment so we can see the one from the development environment and one from the test environment when you specify in the uh rule designer your uh Cloud connection specifying the URL your username and your password automatically here all the URLs for the various uh execution environments are automatically set we can see here the uh production configuration once again with the production environment predefined with the correct URL once defined you can synchronize your decision service with the decision Center just by clicking on this button automatically all your decision service will be pushed to your CL instance from them any business users and release manager are able to access this decision service from the cloud so let's come back to the cloud and have a look to this decision service so to do so I'm going to use today the business console so the business console is the uh web interface that is spec specially designed for business users allowing them to collaborate exchange using the social media style collaborations and and uh update uh their decisions so here we can see all the decisions that are already deployed on on this instance and I'm going to have a look to the fast loan uh service that uh that that compos today uh or today's demonstration so there are two options in odm oncloud you can uh either work with the decision governance framework where you will be completely guided end to end in a governance way uh in a governed way uh through uh to update business decisions uh using spe dedicated activities or use the branch mode so let's use today's the branch mode and have a look to all the um rules and decisions that are governing our today's demonstration so here we can see once again all the rules that have been uh defined and that you can update so we can see for example here a decision table so the decision table that will initialize the score depending on uh the state of the residence of the uh uh customer and and of the of the borrower and the the fact the the flag that tells us if the the request comes from an existing customer of the bank or not depending on these uh parameters we will initialize the score accordingly so here we have seen a decision table you can also uh Define uh a decision using textual uh rules so here we can see one of the of this rule is the amount of the loan is more than 500,000 and the borrower is is is an is not an existing customer then we will add a message to the loan and and then we will reject the loan directly so here we are in an eligibility room as I said an important aspect of uh of odm on on cloud and on the business console is the ability for business user to Define to Define uh simulation Suite here from that environment so here we have some predefined metrics some kpis that the the the user have have have have defined some data that they want to use for the simulation they can also Define the the the the way they want the report to be displayed and all these different item will Define what we call a simulation so the simulation will execute all the rules in the current status and uh uh against all the data that are defined here in the in the data file and we'll compute some predefined kpi so let's start a simulation here we can see the status so the simulation is ongoing and now the simulation is done let's have a look to the report as it has been defined by business user so we can see here in that in that report first that uh 28 loans have been approved five of them have been rejected among these five rejected loans four were existing customers here we can see uh different ways for uh representing uh the kpis so some using some P shots so here we can see that 15% of the uh incoming uh requests were rejected um we can see that most of the uh of the reje rejection were for existing customers uh and the approval ratio per state so here all the data that we can and can display and kpi that we can display here are completely defined from this interface by business users so we can see that the uh the number of rejected customer is is is very high so this is risky for for the insurance because the more of your customer you will reject the more more likely they will be to go to another bank so in order to reduce this uh this attrition the business user decide to try to solve this issue or reduce the risk by creating a new rule so let's see how he can do that in odm on cloud so the first thing is to come to the rule and here in the scoring we will increase the score for existing customer so here we have a bonus rule set in this bonus rule set we are going to to create a new rule let's call it um existing customers and we are going to use the um uh int rule editor that is a contextual poting click editor with automatic completion that allows me to uh find my rotes very easily so if the borrower and then automatically I've got some automatic comp completion is an is an existing customer then I'm going to increase the score of the borrower by 200 points and then I'm going to document this uh this rule by adding a a message so we are going to call message and and existing customer bonus and then we are going to set this message to the loan here we are so the rule isi is is defined I have no more errors here I can save the rule and create a new version of that rule the rule is not yet deployed but we can already measure the impact of that rule so what we are going to do here is to just come back into the simulation and run the exact same simulation as the previous one using the same data so a new report is being generated and we are going to see the impact of that new rule so here's the so the new report is here and what I I I can do is compare side by side this new report with the previous one so that I can really see the impact of my new policy and here I can see that the previous number of existing customer was four and now is it is just three and here we have also uh reduce the number of existing customers that were rejected so as a business user what I will say is this rule does its job and it reduce the number of rejected uh existing customers so the next step for me is to make sure that this rule does not break the Integrity of of of my system to do so so I'm going to use a test stre that also has been defined here from the business console and run this uh this test Suite on my new rules so a test Su consist in defining some some uh scenarios and check the the result for each scenarios if one result with the rules is not matching the expected conditions the expected results then we will get some errors so let's run the test Suite here so behind the scene so we are executing all the the the rules including the new one and we can see the the test reports so all the tests are successful this means that the new rules that I've created is not breaking the the the Integrity of my system for example here uh the for this scenario the loan approach stue was supposed to be true and the result is true the here the credit score of the borrower for that scenario was supposed to be G greater greater than 400 it has been seven uh 170 so all the scenarios and all the condition are match for all in all cases so 100% of suced of success so this means that okay my new rule does not break my Integrity uh the Integrity of the system and now I can deploy it for further test to do that I am a release manager so I have the ability to deploy on the the vales environment so here we can see the two uh deployment configuration that we have defined in the rule designer and deploy in one of these environments so the first thing I'm going to do is Deploy on the test environment so let's do this so now the deployment is ongoing and it's done from my cloud uh instance so I can come to the test environment and start the uh rule EX server console and check that my decision has been correctly uh deployed so here I can see my life Cloud deployment for my decision service and here see a new version of my fast Lo service Ru set that I that I have just undeployed right now so my service my new decision service is deployed on the test environment so if I come back to my uh testing interface what I can do now is using the test environment and start a new uh loan evaluation and here I can see that no my my loan has been accepted and the result the score is is not 290 and we can see that my existing customer bonus rule has been fired for that case if I come back to the production environment we ex we execute the exact same case we are still rejected just because we have not yet deployed on production so odm on clouds allows you to really run and test some and do some validation and testing without impacting your production environment so now what I can see here in this pre-production test is that my new decision service works well with my client application so the next step for me is to deploy the rule uh into the uh production environment so let's do that using this specific uh deployment configuration once again I am a release manager so I am entitled to to deploy on that environment once again from the uh Cloud interface so I can have a look to the rule execution server in production and see all my rules that have been uh rule rule applications that have been deployed and once again the new version of my decision service that has been deployed in production here I am still using the uh the application in production mode it is still running I'm re-executing again the the exact same case and now I'm allowed allowed to to get the loan and and the uh once again I can see the existing customer bonus rule that has been fir so this means that you can deploy new business policies and update your application or business processes with odm oncloud without interrupting the service itself so it brings you a a great visibility so in this demonstration so we have been able to see odm oncloud in action we have been able to see how business uh users can update uh rules run some testing simulation measures the impact of the changes before uh uh putting them into production we have seen the the various uh life cycle for the rul starting from the dev environment uh the test environment and then the production environment and we Al we have also been able to see how easy it is in odm on cloud to manage roles and assign new uh participant and invite new participant to the cloud instance so to conclude this uh this presentation let me give you some uh some some takeaways so here are some top the top 10 values that you can get from odm oncloud so with odm on cloud you benefit from Decades of Investments and Innovation from IBM on the business rul management system domain the service is provisioned in less than 48 hours so you are able to create your first decision very rapidly the service is as I said fully managed by IBM meaning that you will not require any it investment to operate it so it's monthly subscription model gives you a flexibility uh and a visibility on on your Investments Aon Cloud being a software as a service you will not need servers to run it so it reduces capex uh capital expenditure for your organization the user management is self-service as we have seen it does not require any contact to IBM to uh invite new uh participant and assign them with rols you can do that by yourself any odm oncloud instance comes as we have seen with the three death test and production environments making the decision update cycle straightforward the service is secured and kept secured by IBM the odm version are always up to date on this service and IBM will push the new features on the regular basis on on on the cloud so on odm on cloud helps you to control your investment by cutting done license cost due to the hardware investment people required to maintain and operate the system install it configure it update it all these task are fully perform for you by IBM with security so some next steps so the first thing you can do uh is to learn more about odm on cloud visiting the odm dev Center you have here the URL or also visiting the odm product page on ibm.com site then you can evaluate uh IBM operational manager on cloud uh signing up for uh two week free trial uh version from where you will have a full access to the product you have here the link to request your trial version and finally we can do some on-site Workshop uh on uh with your business users and it stakeholders and then during this Workshop we will evaluate the applicability of odm on Cloud for you project thank you for your attention and have a nice day
