so Ewbank is an Australian bank that sells simple deposit products and simple home loan products we consider ourselves a FinTech with a banking license and that really gives us that focus on disruption and thinking about the customer experience first and the banking component second the idea behind Robo chat was really born out of the business need to improve our home loan offering and ultimately helping more customers get through the application process Robo chat started with a hackathon and the hackathon was run using people from right across the U Bank business and and that carried through right through the through the projects and with something that's fairly short and simple sounding as a chatbot it actually involved the whole business so we had marketing helping us with tone-of-voice products helping us with the product questions risk and compliance and legal making sure that we were giving the answers to the customers in the right way and we find bringing everyone along that journey right from the beginning makes that transition to production easier and we have great support from right across the business the tool chain we used for robo chat is largely the IBM cloud DevOps tool chain but the great thing about the IBM approach with its DevOps tool chain is we can incorporate existing parts of eubanks tool chain into the IBM solution so we actually have a hybrid tool chain that is seamlessly integrated into the IBM cloud platform one of the great features of the Watson assistant tool is it's really easy for our business to use so while our developers have built the orchestration layer for us the the front-end toulon that and the chat bot logic and answers are all built in a very easy to use fashion and in fact it's our business analysts that review the logs and make the changes themselves to the chat bot rather than needing to involve the development team so we've found customers pretty happy to engage with Robo chat from the moment that it launched we've been really transparent to our customers about the fact they're talking to a chat bot and that that chat pod is in beta four out of five customers are happy to engage with Robo chat or over chats answered over 20,000 questions and now getting the answer right more than 80 percent of the time on the first attempt and lastly from a business perspective we are seeing significant uplift in conversion rates for those customers that engage with robo chat in fact we're seeing about a 15 percent uplift for customers that engage with robo chat [Music] you
