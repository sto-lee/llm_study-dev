[Music] welcome to the IBM BPM eight five seven zero demonstration on theme support I have open in front of me a client-side human servers called travel requests let's say that this client-side human service along with several others have been deployed in production for a certain amount of time our organization would like to upgrade the look and feel of all the UIs within this process app in the past this would have been accomplished by changing the CSS that is attached to the various coach views and redeploying a new snapshot of the process app in eight five seven a new mechanism called theme support allows a simple centralized mechanism to update the UI s across the process up this mechanism also allows the look and feel to be updated after a process app has been deployed without the need to republish a new version of the process app theme support and BPM is based on less less is an open source CSS pre compiler it adds the ability to define variables and use those in your CSS declarations here is a simple example of some less code we have BPM button primary BG defined as a variable what the value set to it we also have two CSS rules beneath it my button and my section header in their definitions we can see the usage of the variable browsers do not understand less it is compiled into CSS beneath we can see the variable being substituted to create the standard CSS that we're all used to in BPM is a new artifact called a theme which has all the variable declarations in the system coach views that our theme enabled have a dynamic style set on them and this is less code that leverages the variables defined in the theme there is one active theme for process a per toolkit and all coach views within the scope share that styling back in the designer we're going to get started by creating a new team our new theme can be called dark theme when the editor opens we're taken to the design tab design tab shows all the variables on the left group together and a preview on the right showing the result and look and feel the coach views with the current settings to change an aspect of the UI I can hover over the different regions in the preview pane here we can see that the background color is BPM body BG for this area finding that variable on the left I can click on the color swatch which should invoke a dialog for me to pick a new color as soon as I set a new value for the variable we can see the preview is updated on the right hand side let's say we want to change the color for this primary button the background color is BPM button primary BG if we find that on the left side we can see that BPM button primary BG is referring to another theme variable called BPM colored primary we can choose to change the button background color alone or we can choose this more general variable which will be applied to numerous other spots within the UI here we see that the section header and the switch have been updated as well I can continue using this technique to set other aspects of the UI for example I might change the text to be larger here we can see that font size screaming from BPM font size base we can also change some of the border radiuses to soften a look of things I have adjusted a few more variables to achieve the look that I'm after before I close this editor I'm going to go to the source tab in the source tab we can see all the variables on the left and on the right we can see some metadata this is what contributes the variable to the design tab it is possible to add new variables to the theme and use those variables in your custom coach views you can also leverage the same metadata to achieve the easy to use controls for setting the values such as the color pickers and font Pickers now that we have our theme defined we're going to save the editor and set this theme on the process app in the process app settings there's a theme field here here we will select the dark theme we just authored and save this editor if we switch back to the travel request and we wait a few moments we can see the theme is applied the CSS generation happens on the server from the theme artifacts running the client-side human service we can see the theme is applied at runtime as well to complete this demonstration I'm going to show how to update the theme on process apps that are already deployed to a process server this slide shows what we're going to do we have a number of process apps that are deployed to the process server each one depends on the system toolkit and each one is using the default BPM theme we're going to create a new theme toolkit which has the dark theme inside of it and we're going to create a new dummy process app that depends on the theme toolkit we're going to deploy the dummy process app and then use the BPM update theme command to dynamically set the theme on the running process apps without be deploying them I am in process portal where we can see I have the employee travel process deployed if I launch an instance of this process I can see the work item if I accept that work item we can see the default theme is applied to the coach let's update this theme to the dark theme that we just created in process Center we can see the dummy process app that I created this references the toolkit that contains the dark theme I'm going to install this new process app onto that process server I'm logged into the Waze admin console for the process server on which our process apps are deployed I'm going to run the BPM update theme command with the proper parameters we can see that the command is successful so let's go back and rerun our process back in the same process portal is earlier we'll relaunch that process claim the work item we can see that the theme is updated even though we did not redeploy a new version of the travel request process app this concludes the demonstration on theme support in BPM 85 7-0 themes support provides a simple centralized mechanism for controlling the look and feel of all you is within your BPM process apps thank you [Music]
