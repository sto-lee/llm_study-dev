my name is Brian Hildebrand I am the manager of cloud operations for ECI so ECI is services for different vertical markets so there's a field service there's lumber and building materials there's distribution and manufacturing we offer our software as a service so that our customers don't have to go out and buy hardware have to pay people to manage it for them when you think of small medium businesses when they're deploying hardware they're not necessarily deploying it so it's highly available we started with you know 50 users and we're at just over 7,000 or right around 7,000 now so that the amount that it's exploded over time is is not something that we foresaw as we started this the partner piece is key to us you know being a partner with IBM and then us being a partner with our customers and then then being a partner with their customers so it's a nice cascading effect that happens that allows you know everybody to do what they do best right we do software and we do it well our customer does you know lumber or hardware or whatever it might be and they do it well and then their end user their customer they build houses or they do a home repair or whatever and that allows them to focus on what they do best as well so it's a nice line of business that happens there that it allows everybody to focus on what they do best and be able to perform and offer something that's that's exceptional
