We've never done a project where we could 
see such a huge impact on the clients.   So individuals who are faced with mental health 
challenges or economic challenges, having them try   to navigate all of these disparate systems, how 
do we improve that process and that experience? IBM solution really allowed for secured access to 
the data that's all protected in our data center   from the cloud. What the IBM 
product is bringing to the team   an ability for them to really care 
coordinate, have a holistic view,   and then be able to set goals and manage 
their cases right in that technology. With   Watson in the cloud we can actually engage and 
interact with our clients anywhere, at any time. We could really make a difference. We could 
not only serve this population better,   we could also save money while we're doing 
it. This system can be used for any number   of individuals or cohorts of individuals. It is 
a blueprint for how we're going to provide care   across the county. Bringing 
this technology to government   is really revolutionizing and transforming 
the way that government does work.
