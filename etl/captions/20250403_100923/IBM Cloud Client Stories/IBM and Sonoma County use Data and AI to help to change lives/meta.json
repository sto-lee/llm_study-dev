IBM solution really allowed for secured access to \nthe data that's all protected in our data center   from the cloud. What the IBM \nproduct is bringing to the team   an ability for them to really care \ncoordinate, have a holistic view,   and then be able to set goals and manage \ntheir cases right in that technology. With   Watson in the cloud we can actually engage and \ninteract with our clients anywhere, at any time. We could really make a difference. We could \nnot only serve this population better,   we could also save money while we're doing \nit. This system can be used for any number   of individuals or cohorts of individuals. It is \na blueprint for how we're going to provide care   across the county. Bringing \nthis technology to government   is really revolutionizing and transforming \nthe way that government does work."
