and Merlin the biggest challenge was that it was in the toughest industry which is hyper security cybersecurity is a very complex space to begin with it's a very very established industry so coming into the space where the disruptive mind is a unique challenge in itself we wanted to make sure that the cloud technology we choose is native and native cloud technologies are very hard to build in a private cloud environment and that's where kubernetes and containers and the IBM cloud environment became really important so choosing a loosely coupled architecture and choosing IBM cloud private and IBM strains it allowed us to ensure that these processes can run in any cloud the garage was able to provide us the skills that were needed for those technologies which was huge because many times when we choose the technology we just don't have the skills in-house the IBM garage gave us the methodology and it also allowed everyone to think like a product owner so what the garage allows everyone to do is come into an ecosystem where you enhance your own capabilities but you follow a process which is very nimble we've established a very strong product and going forward all we have to do is scale it to an enterprise scale and we can onboard many many new features and technologies like AI like machine learning we can grow with partnerships we are already working with a lot of companies today who want to onboard their solutions on our platform because we are extensible you
