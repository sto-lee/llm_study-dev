So great to be here with you Chris, I think we just got a chance to talk about our\npartnership and what we're doing. Why don't you kick off with you know tell us\na little bit about LogDNA and what you guys do, and then we'll talk about kind\nof our partnership together. Absolutely, thanks for having me this is a super fun\nmoment. LogDNA, we help developers and engineers, DevOps teams monitoring and debug\ntheir production issues. We aggregate all the logs, whether it's from servers or OS\nand platforms and we put into a powerful platform that gives you \nfull visibility into your infrastructure which is pretty fun. That's great, yeah so,\nyou know at IBM Cloud we're trying to build this platform for\ndevelopers, and logging and observability are so important for\ndeveloper productivity, and so you and I started work together a few years ago to\nkind of combine the best of what you guys were doing and bring it to the IBM\nCloud platform. It's been really interesting to me when you tell me a\nlittle bit about like the growth that you guys have seen over the last\nyear. It's been awesome, like we, I love being a customer of IKS and we see the scale and the flexibility that it made perfect sense\nwhen we met two years ago, your world and our world goes hand-in-hand. Right.\nAnd it's nice, we we were big believers in multicloud, we're big\nbelievers in Kubernetes, and it's nice that the bets we made two years ago\nactually paid off, and it's actually the future what we think about together.\nRight. I think what was nice is the simplicity of IBM Cloud match our\nsimplicity of what we think about simple is also powerful from a usability\nperspective, from a scale, from a search, and it's very seamless. That's the best\npart, is the key to developers, and IBM Cloud with the power of LogDNA, so it's a\ngreat win-win scenario. Yeah, I mean, so let's talk about, kind of you as a client\nof IBM Cloud, you know one of the things that attracted me to LogDNA was\nreally two things. One was this incredible user experience that you guys\nhave built around developer need for understanding their environments, and two,\nespecially two or three years ago, very forward-looking on, kubernetes as a\nplatform for running things. So, you know what's worked well for you on\nIBM Cloud? What, do you know, what do you like about it?\nI think simplicity to scale. So when we think about scale we we do a lot, and\nagain I don't know full information but we do a lot, and we have a pretty lean\nteam that could manage that and scale. So, I think nowadays with the power of\nkubernetes you don't have to maintain it as much, right. So, there's like, I\nthink you mentioned that 70/30 rule, in the past you know 70% is is spent\non maintaining infrastructure, it's flipped now, right, and we love that. So it allowed\nus to deploy LogDNA on your infrastructure, pretty efficiently, and\nfrom a customer perspective it's easy to use and it matches with the best out\nthere, so we love it and we're super proud to be to call ourselves customers.\nYeah, and one of the things I think is really interesting is that they take logging\nas a use case. It's not maybe what people typically think of with\nkubernetes, you know, it's very data-intensive, lots of information, high\ningest rates on logs coming in, a lot of processing, not where people really\nstarted with kubernetes. Any struggles they're like..? No. Do you feel that like, you\nknow, I'm doing something on the edge or you know, did it..? I think we always had\nthe foresight of the volume of days growing exponentially. So when you think\nabout that, we had to think about building a platform that's able to\ningest that well and store and search it. The second is because of the\ncomplexity, we knew the complexity because of DevOps, containers, kubernetes,\nit's gonna be complex and the data is going to be fragmented. So how do we make it simple,\nand I think our user experience is always magical, and it should always feel\nthat way. Right. And the third, was like one size does not always fit all, so how do you\ncapture the right platform for developers, versus DevOps, versus security,\nand that is hard to do, and it was a lot of foresight we did, I think we\njust hit our four-year birthday and we had that first foresight of like it\nshould be a beautiful product and less is more. So you're up and running with\nkubernetes with two command lines which is pretty quick. Right. And you tested it.\nYeah. Which is awesome and that's how it should always feel like, you have other\nthings to focus on your priorities, and us handling the infrastructure monitoring\naspect, observability, should be our core focus,\nthat's the benefit of IBM customers. Yeah, so let's talk about our partnership a\nlittle bit, so logging it plays an important role for IBM. You know you are\nthe embedded logging solution within our cloud. Yes. And you know I think the you\nand I have done a lot of work together to try to make that a seamless\nexperience for our users, our joint users. You know one of the ways that I\ntried to push our partnership is IBM being a client of yours as well. Correct.\nWe have this kind of joint relationship which I think is really powerful, and we\nuse LogDNA tremendously within the cloud team, and in other parts of IBM to run our own systems. Yes. Right. And I think that's taught us a lot\nabout you know how to operate at scale, you've pushed kubernetes service hard \nwhich has been good as well. Talk to me a little bit about kind of the\npartnership angle and kind of how its benefited you guys. It's such a win-win\nscenario, So one, we're customers of IBM Cloud.\nSecond, we get to embed OEM, our product to your customer base. Right. And your\ncustomers happens in two folds, it's your customer base that you have but also\nIBM is their own customer. Right. And it's such an honor when we see\nscale and that's the word that resonates a lot, and the reason why you have\nscale is customers that hit Watson uses us, Weather Channel uses us\nand that's a lot of logs, right, and it's being able to handle that infra\nwhich just talks about so much of like enterprise ready product. Yeah, right. Not\njust for IBM, but for IBM's customers as well and just it doesn't get more\nconfidence there versus the other options that were out there. Yeah, one of\nmy personal favorite moments is when I was at the Masters last year and walking\nthrough the Operations Center that IBM runs to run that event and and seeing\nthe team there on the ground who I'd never met using LogDNA using IBM Cloud\nand kind of leveraging that is how they ran that event and all on their own, self\nservice, they just consumed the platform. That's amazing, that's what we're seeing a\nlot of,  just internal teams using it just because it's easy if you're up and\nrunning within minutes. Yeah. And that's how it should always be, but also the\ndata that you're capturing and the value of sending alerts. It's a lot of\nflexibility that's we think for first and foremost of\nour product and it jointly collaborates pretty well. Yeah, so what's next? What do\nis a big thing that you think you guys are focused on next that we can\ngo do together? I think when we talk about like OpenShift is a great\nopportunit,y we talked about Cloud Paks is a great opportunity, and it's\nnice that the technology, our technology is aligned, super aligned with with your future\npath and it comes down to execution. I think being a lean team we get to\nfocus on what matters most, but most importantly our core DNA has always been\ndevelopers, and it's what do developers want, how do they get up to speed, and how\ndo you just get them hooked so that we can land and expand over time. Yeah. That's a\nnew movement that we both share together which is amazing. Yeah, I love\nthe lean team. I remember when we first met and you know I have this really\nsmall focused team and the amount that, I think we all lose sight sometimes of you\nknow with cloud, with public cloud, with technologies like kubernetes, but with\nall these things we were so used to talking about we lose sight of like\nhow much people are able to accomplish with small teams using those platforms.\nIt was awesome, a great communication between the teams. It was just a vote of\nconfidence both ways because the fact that IBM was forward thinking to say who\ndo we partner with, and also the fact that we were able to showcase our\ntechnology from scale as one perspective, flexible deployment, but I also love that\nwe're fully compliant across the board. Yeah. It's PCI, GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA,\nwe were ready. Yeah. And then it doesn't get better alignment then having the\nright overlap. Especially with IBM's kind of focused customer base absolutely\nthe industries that we're in like that was really critical that that layer of\nthe platform which can contain a lot of sensitive data\nmet those requirements and that was really key for us. Right. And I think we get to\ncollaborate of what our future, our UI/UX looks like. Right. I look forward to\nhow do you create predictive graphs, so instead of teams walking in setting up\ntheir own graphs if we know it's kubernetes here's a five graphs you need\nto know and where do you want the alerts being sent. So, we always\nthink about building those magical moments and this should feel magical when developers use us. Yeah, well look Chris, I really appreciate the\npartnership that we've had. I'm excited for what we're doing. I think LogDNA has\nreally proven to be a powerful platform for our\ncustomers and I'm excited for us to continue to collaborate together.\nWell thanks for collaborating and we're just getting started,\nthat's the best part. Great, and for everybody else you know go check out LogDNA on logdna.com, or come to IBM Cloud and check out the offerings that we\nhave there. Thank you very much. Thank you."
