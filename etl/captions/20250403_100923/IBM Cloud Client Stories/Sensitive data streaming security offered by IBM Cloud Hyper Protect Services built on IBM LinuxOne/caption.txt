[Music] we chose IBM because of first and foremost security and then scalability availability agility and reliability all of those are there we were very leery on a lot of the clouds to which one to use when IBM decided to put Z on the cloud it made absolutely perfect sense to us since we already know how secure it is we have to protect our own intellectual property all of our user data and we have all of our authors intellectual property with their stories that we need to protect and the IBM hyper protect offers us that and succeeds and actually does what it says it's going to do our users need to be authenticated and they need to be validated that the number of sessions that there have going are the correct number that they're paying for and we use an app ID and a token system in order to give the authentications and keep everybody's numbers in order we also need to happen now we can't wait six months to put in a new machine and with the IBM cloud we don't have to we call up IBM and say we need to expand here and for how much and they are able to get stuff up and running in less than a day it was 27 hours from the time we said go and to the time it was up and running 11 websites 23 databases 22 million lines of code 15 terabytes of data one of the biggest benefits is that we don't have to have a data center we had billions of data points to tell us IBM works and the IBM cloud was the solution for us it does what it's supposed to do [Music]
