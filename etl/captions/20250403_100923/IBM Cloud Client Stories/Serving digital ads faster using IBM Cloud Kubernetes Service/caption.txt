our cloud journey started with bare-metal services for everything we started off by migrating services to what's called via size virtualized instances after that we made the journey over to kubernetes we have almost 40 micro services under our belt and kubernetes helps us orchestrate and manage those services moving to a micro services architecture without kubernetes would have been a nightmare the amount of manpower required to maintain and service that infrastructure would be magnitudes higher than we currently have in terms of our staff as we switched to kubernetes what happened was the developers began to take control of how applications were configured and how pipelines were built out that actually gave us a lot of efficiencies because it took workload off of the operations teams plate and it put it on to the developers plate which actually created a synergy and that synergy was that instead of us having to rely on a separate team to do configuration management the developers were able to figure out what that app needed in terms of resources and they can build their own docker files and what they ran locally on their machine was what was deployed out to the cloud with manage kubernetes we've been able to create environments within minutes we can build up a new cluster we can configure it and we can give a team that needs an integration environment the services they need and in isolated region we can continue our work as a development team on building other features or our customers require so we can break things without the fear that we're tearing up someone else's integration environment that's some functionality that we never had before kubernetes has greatly improved our velocity in terms of spinning up data centers what used to take us a month to spend up an entire data center we can now do within 24 hours steel house chose Sto as our service mesh for several reasons the security that it provides and the ability to do retry logic on HTTP requests sto providing retry logic without us having to modify our code is a huge benefit the big benefits we've seen from our cloud strategy have been our abilities to move faster develop and deploy quicker and have better insight into our applications and to do all this with a better SLA because we were able to leverage our cloud providers manage services that allows our team to seem bigger than it is you
