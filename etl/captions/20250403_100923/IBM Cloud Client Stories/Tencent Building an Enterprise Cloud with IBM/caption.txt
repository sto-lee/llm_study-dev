A lot of enterprise customers come to us, and they wanna get help from Tencent, and Tencent cloud. You know all over the world people will ask for IBM consulting, IBM cloud, and now, I think maybe IBM can bring us to this enterprise world, so we can work together to change this kind of enterprise view. So that means they will
put a lot of effort and research and determine
the clouds strategy, how to serve their customers, how to help their
customers to grow on cloud. If we put our product onto IBM cloud for the customers, they have the same experience, and they can extend it
to any other regions that are IBM cloud has. I believe that if we can now say that we work with IBM at enterprise level, the companies will be convinced that we can deliver a more
comprehensive solutions for them together with IBM because now, you know, cloud change everything. Especially, now, I think we'll be most of the gaming, internet, mobile apps are cloud based. And the last and important
part is enterprise. How we can using Tencent
