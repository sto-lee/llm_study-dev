when it comes to application resource management for cloud you don't want to pay for over-provisioning on the other hand you don't want to risk angry customers if your applications start failing due to lack of resources this begs the question is intelligent and automated resource management critical for app performance for modern organizations the answer is an easy yes hi i'm dan keen from ibm cloud when your apps run well your customers have a great experience and your development operations team remain focused on their top initiatives but before we dive into smarter resource allocation i'll give three reasons why traditional estimations simply don't work one estimates can't assure the performance of increasingly complex applications two estimates frequently try to assure performance by over-provisioning resource allocations three in multi-cloud and cloud-native environments managing application resources manually is beyond human scale so what's the key to overcome these barriers you need to automate the allocation of application resources to absorb shifting user demands and deliver target response times that's why turbonomic arm for ibm cloud pack exists terminomic provides a top-down metrics driven approach that continuously analyzes application resource needs resources are allocated through visibility insights and actions at every layer of the application and infrastructure stack best of all these decisions are made automatically without human intervention let's take a look in addition to ibm observability by instant apm terminomic integrates with other apm systems they retrieve key application metrics such as infrastructure compute network and storage all the resources your application depends upon terminomic then determines which resources contribute to user response time and provision appropriate capacity to avoid contention next let's turn our attention to insights how can you assure resource allocations perform in the smartest way possible it's all about the ai terminomic maintains the necessary app resources to deliver expected end-user response times while respecting configuration policies and minimizing waste think about the economic principles of supply and demand demand is based on production application metrics the supplies based on known resources and their policy and cost constraints smarter resource allocation means taking intelligent action an analytics engine automatically generates and executes resource balancing actions when and how you want them it's done in real time manually scheduled or part of a workflow okay let's wrap this up with terminomic applications choose their own resources through visibility insights and actions at every layer of the stack applications are dynamically resourced for performance absorbing peak demands and adhering your business policies best of all you can abandon guesswork and embrace smarter application resource management thanks for watching if you'd like to see more videos like this in the future please click like and subscribe and if you want to learn more about ibm terminomic arm for cloudbacks make sure to check out the links in the description
