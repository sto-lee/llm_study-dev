Meet Theresa. She's a CIO at a major insurance provider and she's feeling stressed. Her board wants her to
improve customer NPS, reduce loss adjustment expenses, and speed market responsiveness. That's not possible with her current claims processing system. It's complex, it's manual, and it's slow. She needs a resilient, scalable way to react nimbly to market
demands and delight customers. In other words, she
needs a modern approach to transform her operations. Her solution? IBM Cloud Paks. (upbeat music) The AI-powered hybrid cloud software is built on Red Hat OpenShift and managed through one
intelligent control plane. So it's quick and easy for Theresa to start building, modernizing, and managing applications securely across any cloud with confidence. Because IBM Cloud Paks are pre-certified and pre-integrated, Theresa can empower the
