To handle extreme levels of network volatility, they're embracing cloud and virtualization\nto deliver the 5G and edge services that their customers' demand. Also, many CSPs recognize the potential of AI to automate problem detection and remediation. Enter IBM Cloud Pak for Network Automation. Based on years of IBM experience working with\ntelecom partners, IBM Cloud Pak for Network Automation helps CSPs\ntransform their networks, evolve to zero-touch operations,\nreduce operating expense, and deliver services faster. What does this mean for CTOs? Their teams can rapidly design, deploy, and scale new services in minutes instead of days, improving\ncustomer responsiveness. But this transformation demands team players. Imagine you're a Network Service Engineer. You’re using the intent-based orchestration within IBM Cloud Pak for Network Automation\nto reduce the work required to launch a new network service offering. Bringing a new service online no longer means\nracking hardware or manual installation steps. You start by creating a service package from\na template. It's composed of a set of\nnetwork functions, services running in containers,\nor services from your Virtual Network Functions. You package and test the newly-assembled components\nbefore deploying them to production. Once your team is satisfied the offering meets\ncustomer requirements and your quality assurance standards, the fully tested package is added\nto the product catalog. To save time and avoid human error, catalog\nadditions are done following an automated CI/CD process. With the services available in the catalog,\nyour customers can order them as needed. For example, a Mobile Virtual Network Operator\ncould quickly order a virtual radio access network, or vRAN, service. Or an enterprise could order a 5G Network\nSlice service for a specific time AND purpose. Your customers don't need to know what's going\non behind the scenes. When the order is placed, IBM Cloud Pak for\nNetwork Automation will decide which specific network functions are required to deliver\nthat service orchestrated from scratch. Or, if the service is already up and running,\nmaking the appropriate configuration changes. In this example, the service order and delivery\nwere entirely self-service. No call-in was required! Once the service is deployed, IBM Cloud Pak for Network Automation, combined with IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, automatically monitors the environment by tracking events, key performance indicators, and \nchanges in the network topology. Here's the main dashboard for network operations\nthat interests your Site Reliability Engineers, or SREs - it shows a real-time health status\nof the network and services along with correlated events and a service topology overview. Although automation may take place without\nhuman intervention, the SRE can validate what the system has done. They don't have to watch the dashboard minute-by-minute, and they have a full history of key system events. By proactively dealing with network anomalies\nahead of customer impact, your operations team will have fewer fire drills and less\nneed for human intervention. But sometimes applying an automated resolution\nisn't prudent. For such cases, IBM Cloud Pak for Network\nAutomation notifies the appropriate engineer with AI-based recommendations for next best actions. So, to wrap this up, IBM Cloud Pak for Network\nAutomation can help you rapidly design, deploy, and scale new services in minutes instead of days. And it helps you lower costs by moving your\nteam towards zero-touch operations. The best part: since it’s built on Red Hat\nOpenShift, you can run it on any cloud, anywhere. Thanks for watching.
