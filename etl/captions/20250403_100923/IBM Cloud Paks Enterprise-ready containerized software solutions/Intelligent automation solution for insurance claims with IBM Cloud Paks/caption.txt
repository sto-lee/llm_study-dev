i'm dirk deroos lead cloud pack demo architect we're going to take a look at how ibm's cloud packs can help insurance companies modernize their approach to automotive claims processing today processing auto insurance claims is inefficient slow and costly the claims adjustment workflow is filled with manual tasks and this is a huge factor in keeping the average time to resolution for claims high also adjusters under time pressure need to make judgment calls based on limited information this results in many claims having higher than needed adjustment payouts these delays and error-prone processes lead to poor customer experiences at the same time traditional insurers are under pressure from insurer tech startups who are disrupting the auto insurance space so to help insurers ibm has developed an intelligent workflow for processing auto claims at the center of this are ibm's cloud packs which enable you to build flexible modern applications this represents a transformative change in the way insurers handle claims so basically we're setting a data driven approach to support decision making and we're automating 75 percent of the claims processing steps we have a simulated insurance company that has provided its customers with this mobile app caitlyn smithers has just been in an accident where someone rear-ended her car so she's starting this claim from her phone we can see a chat bot engage with her and gather information as the claim progresses on the agent dashboard we can now see a new claim being initiated the app actually pushes a request to open the claim in the existing claim management application sitting in the data center there's no agent driving this process all the blue dots to the right of the tasks you can see here represent fully automated work and the red dots show tasks that a human needs to do for example where we see caitlyn responding to requests for information as she does this we can see the dashboard light up with data points and get fleshed out we can also see green dots next to some tasks as well like invoke fraud investigation these are tasks performed using ai capabilities so here the system feeds information about the claim to a fraud evaluation model and as a more complete picture of the claim emerges the models actually predict a low likelihood of fraud and that this claim has low complexity based on this evaluation the insurer has now authorized the repairs and presents caitlyn with repair choices towing and transportation from the accident site and back in the app caitlyn is presented with a settlement offer which she can then accept so let's look at what's behind these apps in the intelligent claims workflow we're going to start with the insurance companies data center now for any established insurance company their existing it infrastructure is mission critical it's got decades of use investment and keeps their business running every day there are always needs for increased flexibility but there's very little appetite to build this in because migrating from that established infrastructure is expensive and disruptive as a starting point for the solution we just saw we're going to leave the established claims management application and any supporting software like databases in place next up is the cloud pack for business automation one of its major components is the business automation workflow tooling what we're looking at here is a detailed graph of over 70 tasks that make up the claims adjustment process a business process analyst and this isn't a coder has built this out as an automated workflow and in the app that we just saw it's actually this workflow that drives the whole automated claims adjustment process so now we're looking at cloud pack for data which is an ecosystem for everyone whether you're a data scientist or a business user to work together on data projects this is one of the tools auto ai which is training our fraud evaluation model a really important design point that's baked into this tooling is trust your data stewards can make sensitive data available for data scientists to do their work and at the same time define policies that actually hides customers private information and trust doesn't just apply to data it also has to apply to machine learning models we saw in the agent dashboard for example that caitlin's claim had a low likelihood for fraud and with club pack for data's model explainability we can show the claims adjuster the reasons behind that and now we're looking at watson assistant which powers that chatbot that we saw engaging with caitlin it integrates with our automated workflow giving caitlin an easy customer experience which ultimately helps her deal quickly with the accident cloudpack for integration is the glue that ties all these pieces together integration developers use appconnect api connect and kafka flows to enable the mobile app and the claims dashboard to talk with the claims management application in the backend data center and finally application developers have built a set of cloud native microservices that use all the capabilities that we've looked at to power the mobile app and the claim agent dashboard everything in this architecture diagram except the original infrastructure in the data center is running in openshift here i'm looking at the openshift container service i can see all the pods that are powering the cloud packs and also the new claims processing microservices for the dashboard and the mobile app this container platform has a common interface for devops and administration of this whole solution since it's based on openshift i can deploy and run this anywhere i want it can be in the same data center as the existing infrastructure i can be on ibm's cloud where i'm running it now or some other vendors cloud and what's worth calling out here is that while we've greatly modernized the claims processing practice we've kept the original systems intact this saves us money time and reduces risk and disruption what we've built here is an almost entirely automated process and this frees customer service agents and claims adjusters to focus on higher value work the insurance company provides a faster and more flexible clean process for their customers and also embeds machine learning models in the workflow that helps the claims adjusters 25 of adjustment tasks are aided with these models this means adjusters can make much better decisions for difficult areas like assessing total loss amounts and the likelihood of liability by taking advantage of their existing customer base and wealth of data we've used ibm's cloud packs to help traditional insurance companies set a solid competitive advantage over new companies encroaching in this market you
