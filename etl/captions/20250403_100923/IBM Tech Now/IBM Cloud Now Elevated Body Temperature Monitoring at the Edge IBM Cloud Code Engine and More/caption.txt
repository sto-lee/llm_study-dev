checking for elevated body temps with edge-enabled cameras the launch of ibm cloud code engine and a look at the ibm cloud community all on this episode of ibm cloud now what's up y'all my name is ian and i am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements from ibm cloud last episode i talked about an awesome way that edge-enabled cameras could help businesses detect if customers were wearing their masks properly and today i want to touch on another way that this tech can help the world reopen a little more safely a very important aspect of a safe and healthy return to work is the ability to monitor workers and customers for elevated body temperatures real-time ai based video analytics enable thermal or infrared cameras at business entrances to screen body temperatures when the cameras register a high temp they generate alerts that allow you to assess the person for risk ibm edge application manager places analytical workloads with the edge-enabled cameras and the system sends results to the ibm maximo worker insights platform privacy is built right into the detection process so it doesn't share any personal identification data and there are no transmission or processing costs to learn more about this tech and other ways that ibm edge application manager can contribute to a safe and healthy return to work see the blog link below next up i've got something for all the developers out there i'm excited to introduce ibm cloud code engine our newest platform for hosting all of your cloud native workloads ibm cloud code engine is a fully managed serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads including both interactive http driven applications and run to completion batch jobs don't have a container image we've got you covered code engine will take your source code combine it with a supported runtime environment and then create and run the container for you you don't even have to worry about the underlying infrastructure code engine takes care of all the cluster management including provisioning configuring scaling and managing servers and depending on the load code engine automatically scales your containers up or down including scaling to zero so you only pay for the resources you actually use seems like a pretty good deal right best of all it's all free while we're in beta to get started with code engine see the links in the description finally i want to close out this episode by shining a spotlight on the ibm cloud community ibm community is the online platform for ibm user and technology enthusiasts who want to share learn and do more with ibm products and associated tech it offers a constant stream of freshly updated content including featured blogs forums for discussion and collaboration and access to the latest white papers webcasts presentations and events created specifically for members by members there are two main communities public cloud and middleware these two groups boast over 70 000 members globally more than 25 topic user groups and hundreds of forums and educational webinars so whether you want to connect with peer users in your industry take advantage of exclusive events and resources or build your online influence by contributing content click the link in the description and join the ibm cloud community today thanks for joining me today for this episode of ibm cloudnow if you're interested in learning more about the topics i've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel and stay up to date on what's going on in the cloud now
