a safe return to work with the help of edge computing the all-new ibm cloud security and compliance center in the introduction of ibm cloud databases from mongodb enterprise all on this episode of ibm cloudnow what's up everyone my name is ian and i'm back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements from ibm cloud i want to start the show by talking about a really cool way that edge computing is being used to help businesses reopen and operate safely we know face masks can substantially reduce the transmission of aerosol-borne viruses but sometimes people forget to wear them properly or at all ibm edge application manager places analytical workloads with edge-enabled cameras that can recognize face masks and determine if they're being worn effectively since analysis is performed at the camera the video data and individual privacy are protected you also avoid the expense of transmitting storing or analyzing that image data any further alerts are sent every time the camera detects an improperly worn or non-existent face mask then it sends the aggregated data back to the ibm maximo worker insights platform allowing you to highlight face mask activity in your facilities it's pretty amazing stuff right and that's only scratching the surface if you check out the blogs in the description you'll also find out how ibm edge application manager is using edge computing to monitor crowd density social distancing and elevated body temps of those who are entering an establishment so click the links below to learn more and make sure you're wearing your mask right next up as enterprises move regulated workloads to public cloud we believe that is essential to establish successful cultures of continuous cloud security and compliance and that's why we're really proud to introduce the ibm cloud security and compliance center in collaboration with ibm research it's a solution that is built directly into the cloud platform and ready to use the security and compliance center allows you to build checks into everyday workloads and it is comprised of the simplification of three different capabilities security and compliance posture management configuration governance and security insights it's really easy to get started and if you click on the blog linked in the description you'll be able to follow a tutorial that will get you rolling with a security and compliance center finally i want to close out this episode by introducing ibm cloud databases for mongodb enterprise now customers can tap into the full power of mongodb for enterprise applications especially those in regulated environments that need powerful data encryption capabilities and auditability our partnership with mongodb allows you to leverage the latest mongodb features in authentic apis while taking advantage of full automation of some of the more common painstaking database administration tasks databases for mongodb enterprise goes above and beyond the standard plan by offering a bunch of features for security performance and auditability this includes access to mongodb metrics performance advisor and data explorer through our ops manager portal an auditing capability for your mongodb instances and fips algorithms and automatic client-side encryption to learn more about databases for mongodb enterprise see the link i've got below thanks for joining me today for this episode of ibm cloud now if you're interested in learning more about the topics i've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in the cloud now
