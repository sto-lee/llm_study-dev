exciting news around the launch of ibm cloud satellite and the open beta of ansible actions in ibm cloud schematics all on this episode of ibm cloud now what's up y'all my name is ian and i am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements from ibm cloud to start things off i am thrilled to announce a significant milestone in the expansion of our hybrid cloud capabilities with a new offering called ibm cloud satellite ibm cloud satellite makes it possible for you to build faster securely anywhere you can now deploy ibm cloud services securely in any environment public cloud private cloud on premises or at the edge since satellite operates as a distributed cloud environment it extends the same security inherent within ibm cloud no matter where data is being collected processed or shared with ibm cloud satellite you can run workloads where it makes the most sense because ibm cloud is architected with an open source kubernetes foundation for greater portability to the satellite locations you'll have access to a rich catalog of cloud services and enjoy simplified service availability and control this means a single dashboard common identity and access management policies and centralized observability across all your satellite locations this will help you achieve end-to-end security where data and workloads reside for all the exciting details on the launch of ibm cloud satellite see the link in the description of this video in keeping with the satellite theme ibm is also extending watson anywhere making it possible to bring ai workloads to your data using ibm cloud pack for data as a service with ibm cloud satellite you can eliminate the need to move data around or copy from other public clouds to get insights data science teams can efficiently build machine learning models in the cloud and then run the models in the same cloud region where your data is stored this means a completely seamless data analytics experience as a result businesses can see significant performance improvements when ai workloads are co-located with data maintain data sovereignty and compliance as data remains in-country leverage the best talent wherever they are and avoid data egress costs since data doesn't need to be transferred out of the public cloud for more info on ibm cloud pack for data as a service with ibm cloud satellite check out the blog i've got link below okay to close out this episode i want to let you know about the open beta of ansible actions in ibm cloud schematics ansible is an open source software provisioning configuration management and application deployment tool that enables infrastructure as code schematics enables you to import ansible playbooks define input configuration and control the lifecycle of ansible automation schematic supports two primary approaches to automation workspaces which are terraform-based and actions which are ansible-based terraform is primarily used for provisioning and ansible excels at configuration management and application deployment put them together terraform and ansible are a perfect match for end-to-end infrastructure automation to get started with the open beta of ansible actions and schematics hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of ibm cloud now if you're interested in learning more about the topics i've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in the cloud now you
