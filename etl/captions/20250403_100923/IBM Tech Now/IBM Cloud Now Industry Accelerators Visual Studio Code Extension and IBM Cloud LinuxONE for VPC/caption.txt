industry accelerators for ibm cloud pack for data as a service a visual studio code extension and the ga of ibm cloud linux one for vpc all on this episode of ibm cloud now what's up y'all my name is ian and i am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements from ibm cloud if you and your organization are looking for a great way to get started with ai quickly i've got something for you we're going to begin this week with a look at the all new industry accelerators for ibm cloud pack for data as a service these industry accelerators are downloadable and customizable sample applications built for actual use cases to help you learn about specific challenges they provide a pre-built package of assets that demonstrates how to address common business issues allowing you to go from demonstration to implementation in hours rather than weeks or even months a typical accelerator workflow allows you to clean and prepare data run machine learning algorithms and score the resulting model in short this is the perfect way to close the data science skills gap and quickly get started with ai that is tailored to your business needs we've got industry accelerators available around highly requested business use cases in the financial markets energy and utilities and insurance industries to get started with any of these projects visit the ibm cloud pack for data as a service gallery that you can find through the link i've got in the description of this video up next i want to talk about the beta release of a visual studio code extension for ibm cloud schematics this extension can be installed on an existing visual studio code installation with it you can develop test and deploy your terraform templates from within the vs code without the need to switch between github and the ibm cloud console ui or cli so what does this mean simply put it eases the iteration in developing terraform templates with ibm cloud schematics this extension also provides three custom tasks for vs code you can use the build task to author and validate your terraform templates got the deploy task to deploy the terraform template to schematics and you can use the clone task to clone the terraform template from either an existing schematics workspace or new git repository to try out the visual studio code extension for ibm cloud schematics check out the link i've got below to wrap things up for this episode i'm excited to announce the general availability of ibm cloud linux 1 for vpc linux 1 for vpc are virtual servers based on the linux 1 processor architecture that bring the advantages of the platform together with the advantages of virtual private cloud this means that linux one is available as a choice in the public cloud for the first time and it provides unique options if you're looking to develop in the public cloud with the backing of an enterprise-grade linux server besides the virtual private cloud these virtual servers come with a litany of other benefits including simplified logging and monitoring backup and restore file share snapshot and much more to get started with ibm cloud linux one for vpc hit the link i've got below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of ibm cloud now if you're interested in learning more about the topics i've covered make sure you explore the links in the description in this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in the cloud now you
