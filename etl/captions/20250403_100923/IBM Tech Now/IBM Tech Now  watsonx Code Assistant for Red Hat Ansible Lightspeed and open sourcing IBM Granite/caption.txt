open sourcing IBM's Granite code models and IBM Watson X code assistant for Red Hat anable light speed all on this episode of IBM Tech now to get things started this week IBM is releasing a family of granite code models to the open-source Community the aim is to make coding as easy as possible for as many developers as possible what is granite you ask Granite is a family of IBM built Foundation models that are available in Watson x. developed by IBM research the granite models use a decoder architecture which is what underpins the ability of today's large language models to predict the next word in the sequence we're releasing a series of decoder only Granite code models for code generative tasks trained with code written in 116 programming languages these models have a wide range of uses from complex application modernization tasks to on device memory constrained use cases with tools built on the IBM Granite code models we Envision a ton of ways to make developers lives easier including agents that could write code tools that can explain why code isn't working and suggestions for how to fix it much of a developer's day may be consumed with tedious but essential tasks including generating unit tests writing documentation or running vulnerability tests we're hoping that the open sourcing of these models can help automate these tasks so why are we doing this simply put we believe in the power of open Innovation to get to a future where writing code is as easy as talking to an alwayson assistant we want to reach as many developers as possible no effective system is ever created by a single individual the best work Builds on the collective knowledge of those who have come before we're excited to see what you'll build with these models whether that's new code generation tools state-of-the-art editing software or anything in between to learn more about the open sourcing of granite check out the link in the description of this video next up we're going to take a look at another solution designed to support AI assisted code development and application modernization IBM Watson X code assistant for Red Hat anible light speed it accomplishes these tasks by equipping developers with Gen capabilities to accelerate the creation of anible playbooks in early 2024 we introduced model customization and a no cost 30-day trial for this product now building on this momentum we are excited to announce the on premises release of Watson X code assistant for Red Hat anible light speed set for General availability in June this release features exciting new capabilities including Playbook generation and explanation Playbook generation with Watson X code assistant for Red Hat anible light speed offers a chat style experience that allows you to generate and explain anible content from single task prompts it collects your prompts and returns an outline of an anible Playbook simplifying the process of creating an understanding anible content all of this will accelerate and democratize anible content creation help you acquire comprehensive of explanations of anable content and centralized recommendation information to learn more about the on premises release of Watson X code assistant for Red Hat anable light speed hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up todate on what's going on in Tech now [Music]
