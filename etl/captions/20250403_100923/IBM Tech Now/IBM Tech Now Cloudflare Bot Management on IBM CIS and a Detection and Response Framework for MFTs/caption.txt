cloudflare bot Management on ibmcis and a detection and response framework for managed file transfer software all on this episode of IBM Tech now what's up y'all my name is Ian and I am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements about IBM technology start things off this week IBM and cloudflare are announcing cloudflare bot Management on IBM CIS a new offering to help protect Enterprises from bot attacks malicious bot attacks are becoming more sophisticated and manual mitigations are becoming more burdensome bot attacks have the potential to damage Brands steal sensitive information take over accounts and negatively impact the bottom line of any organization Enterprises running internet-facing workloads neither Dynamic and adaptive solution and that's precisely what cloudflare bot management provides the offering is designed to help users better manage Bots by applying a number of different detection methods first is enhanced behavioral analysis which helps organizations Monitor and respond to abnormal traffic patterns across critical internet applications to mitigate potential bot threats in near real time second is bot identification through machine learning using a bot score it provides a single simplified value to represent the likelihood of a request Being Human or a bot and third is risk mitigation through fingerprinting cloudflare leverages fingerprinting from millions of Diversified internet properties to accurately classify Bots it does not however generate or store device fingerprints which can help to reduce the risk to user privacy the bot management feature is available now for any IBM Cloud internet service clients using the Enterprise Premiere plan to learn more check out the link in the description of this video next up over the past year hundreds of organizations have been compromised through managed file transfer attacks the mass exploitation of move it and go anywhere has elevated mfts into a prominent attack Factor these Internet connected automated Services enable the transfer of sensitive Enterprise data between parties so by compromising mfts threat actors can expedite their attacks immediately jumping to the data exfiltration stage IBM security X-Force decided to investigate they found that all of these mft tools are largely architected the same way which means that the approach to detection and response would generally be the same so X-Force recently released an index that includes a sample of 13 different detection and response Frameworks for the most common and exposed mft Solutions this effort is meant to offload some of these learnings from Defenders significantly reducing the time required for Defenders to stop an attack and helping to prevent future Mass exploitation X-Force also turned to Watson X and created an easy repeatable process to assess assets by their attractiveness to attackers using one of IBM's Foundation models they created a proof-of-concept AI engine that analyzes documentation forums system data and correlates with environmental context this enables security teams to quickly understand the underlying components of a solution so that they can develop a detection and response strategy this proof of concept is really exciting because it provides evidence that Foundation models can Empower Defenders tremendously and optimize their use of time to learn more hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now
