cyber exposure insights nist postquantum cryptography standards and Watson X code assistant for Z 2.1 all on this episode of IBM Tech now cyber security is becoming more and more challenging for Enterprises with a 71% year-over-year increase in cyber attacks that use stolen or compromised credentials and one in three data breaches involving Shadow data the proliferation of data is making it harder to trade track and Safeguard that's why IBM xforce launched cyber exposure insights as part of its threat intelligence services this new service allows you to understand your cyber exposure to strengthen defenses before an attack occurs with cyber exposure insights you can monitor the surface deep and dark web to detect potential safety risks and identify atrisk credentials before criminals do identify instances of brand impersonation and monitor social media for signs of forthcoming attacks monitor suspicious domains to identify ones associated with malicious activities such as fishing attacks or driveby downloads and Implement takedowns to minimize Digital Risk essentially cyber exposure insights provides comprehensive monitoring of brand impersonation stolen credentials data exposure and dark web threats across the entire web it's an early warning system that can help you move from reactive to proactive empowering you to take preventative actions before or a potential breach reeks Havoc to learn more check out the link in the description of this video next up the US National Institute of Standards and technology or nist has released federal information processing standards Publications for three Quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms this announcement serves as an inflection point in modern cyber security as the global Benchmark for cryptography the NIS standard signals that the time has come to make the world's information security systems resistant to Future cryptographically relevant quantum computers nist finalized the following three pqc standards to strengthen modern public key cryptography infrastructure for the quantum era first is mlkm a key encapsulation mechanism selected for General encryption such as for accessing secured websites second is mlda a lattice-based algorithm chosen for general purpose digital signature protocols and third is slh diesa a stateless hash-based digital signature scheme those first two standards were developed by IBM research cryptography researchers in Zurich with external collaborators and the third was co-developed by a scientist who has since joined IBM research nist has been encouraging organizations to plan and prepare for the quantum safe migration in advance of this moment however the release of the standards gives organizations the assurance and guidance they need to begin the transition to postquantum cryptography to learn more hit the link below to finish things up today let's talk a little about IBM Watson X code assistant for Z which is built to assist developers Architects and system programmers in modernizing their Mainframe applications through the use of generative Ai and automation available now code assistant for Z 2.1 further assists developers and system programmers in optimizing Cobalt application performance and understanding JCL code the First new feature is code optimization advice which is designed to streamline cobal application development and enhance performance this capability addresses the challenges faced by developers working with cobal applications and empowers them to deliver efficient and modern code the second new feature is that code explanation is now enhanced to include support for JCL enabling system programmers to gain knowledge of JCL and Z automation assets faster to learn more about code assistant 2.1 and the new features hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and of course please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up Tod dat on what's going on in Tech now [Music]
