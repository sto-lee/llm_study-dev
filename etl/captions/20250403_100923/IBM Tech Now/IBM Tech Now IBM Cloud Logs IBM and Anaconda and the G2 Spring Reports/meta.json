Anaconda allows data scientists to use Python and open source to unleash Innovation with AI Watson x. a users can now access anaconda's natively built open source python repository and Anaconda distribution provides users with python open source package management Watson x.i can also integrate with Anaconda repository on premises for python security vulnerability management and license management python continues to be the leading language for data science and generative AI workloads in 2024 and Anaconda is the gateway to the open source python Community providing curated access to the packages powering Enterprise AI through this collaboration Watson x. brings generative AI models to clients and Anaconda brings Enterprise grade python to enhance Enterprise AI to learn more about this exciting collaboration hit the link below to wrap things up today the G2 spring reports were recently released and I'm thrilled to let you know that IBM offerings were featured in more than 12200 unique G2 reports earning over 250 leader badges across various categories these accolades are given to offerings that receive positive reviews from verified users compared to competitive products in their respective categories ibant products and solutions ranked number one in 95 unique reports including IBM Watson X assistant in the bot platforms grid report an IBM app connect in the ESB grid report additionally IBM products and solutions ranked in the top three and another 249 unique reports for a full rundown of IBM in the G2 spring reports hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up toate on what's going on in Tech [Music] now"
