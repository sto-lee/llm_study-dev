the introduction of IBM Watson code assistant IBM hybrid Cloud mesh and IBM event automation all on this episode of IBM Tech now what's up y'all my name is Ian and I am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements about IBM technology if you tuned in last episode you saw me cover the news out of think around Watson X and its components but that wasn't the only news to come out of the event on this episode I'm going to cover three new Innovative products that were also recently previewed and introduced setting the stage for an exciting 2023 first up is something that Arvin previewed in his keynote address IBM Watson code assistant Watson code assistant is an Innovative solution that empowers developers across all skill levels to write syntactically correct code with AI generated recommendations powered by Watson x.ai Foundation models Watson code assistant will increase developer productivity by providing recommended code based on natural language inputs ultimately the aim is to make hybrid Cloud code development more accessible and efficient Watson code assistant is intended to be generally available later this year it's designed to reduce the complexity of coding through these AI generated content recommendations additionally organizations will be able to tune the underlying Foundation model and customize it with their own standards the first available use case for Watson code assistant will be content generation for Red Hat ansible automation platform and you can check out the link below for more information next up is IBM hybrid Cloud mesh a new multi-cloud networking solution that will be generally available in the second half of this year hybrid Cloud mesh is designed to allow organizations to establish simple and secured application-centric connectivity and it's engineered for Network managers to be able to seamlessly manage and scale Network applications across public clouds private clouds Edge and on-premises this application first approach is the next important networking Paradigm it represents an evolution from the current fat pipes method which doesn't differentiate between applications to one that aligns the network to the needs of the business users developers and their CI CD Pipeline and devops Cycles when it's time to configure new Cloud networks and connect applications our approach is designed to turn weeks into hours and move from manual to automated processes to learn more and apply to the Early Access program of IBM hybrid Cloud mesh hit the link below the final announcement I want to cover today is IBM event automation every day thousands of business events flow through your organization that can provide a wealth of information IBM event automation is designed to help you put those events to work by enabling business and it users to detect situations in real time act on them and Trigger automations to help maximize their revenue potential this can help your organization become more responsive to customer needs and resilient in the face of Shifting market dynamics IBM event automation provides an intuitive and integrated experience that includes event distribution event Discovery and event processing it'll be generally available in late June you can check out the link below to learn more thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now
