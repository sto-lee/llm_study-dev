Studio this means you can access some of our most popular AI models ask the questions and see how they respond really gives you a taste of some of the capabilities of large language models in this first release of the Watson x. a demo you can access five model types during the AI solution development life cycle it's important to be able to quickly test multiple models interact with them collect feedback and share them with peers with this new demo tool we aim to pave the way for a future of accelerated time to value for popular common patterns to learn more about this 30-day demo or start up complete Watson x. trial check out the link in the description of this video next up the world recently celebrated Earth Day with 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record it's crucial to examine how data and AI can be applied to many areas to help supercharge sustainability efforts when looking at how to use data and Technology to advance sustainability initiatives across the globe we believe there are three core areas that every organization should focus on the first is sustainability strategy data and Reporting essentially we should be using data in AI to drive a sustainability strategy while meeting reporting requirements AI can turn Intel into insights faster enabling businesses to drive towards sustainability goals and financial targets more quickly the second is energy transition and climate resilience we need to apply Ai and the internet of things to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources the third is intelligent asset facility in infrastructure management this means leveraging AI to build efficient physical operations manage costs and reduce the environmental footprint to learn more about the future of AI and sustainability hit the link below to wrap things up today the explosion in interest and Adoption of AI is forcing it leaders to revisit their capacity plans and increase compute resources many Enterprises are realizing that to maximize the value of their AI Investments infrastructure needs to scale rapidly and efficiently to deliver AI insights where and when they need them in 2022 IBM introduced the groundbreaking IBM Z16 featuring an onchip AI inference accelerator focused on accelerating AI model execution today we are announcing the AI bundle for IBM Z and Linux 1 this Builds on the success of the IBM Z16 or linux4 by providing new dedicated capacity for AI workloads with a highly optimized software stack with a curated Suite of AI soft software you can manage AI model life cycles in one place allowing for the quick deployment of a wide range of use cases additionally by leveraging the IBM telm processor with the integrated accelerator for AI you can run inferencing for a high volume workloads at scale to learn more about the AI bundle for IBM Z in Linux 1 hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up todate on what's going on in Tech now [Music]"
