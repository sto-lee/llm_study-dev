llama 3.1 the EU AI act and a new IBM Cloud VPC sandbox all on this episode of IBM Tech now on July 23rd meta announced the launch of the Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual large language models llama 3.1 comprises both pre-trained and instruction tune text in text out open-source generative AI models these models come ins size of 8B 70b and for the first time 405b parameters now this instruction tuned llama 3.1 405b figures to be the largest and most powerful open-source language model available today even making it competitive with the best proprietary models on the market perhaps even more importantly llama 3.1 provides the global AI Community with an open state-of-the-art model family and development ecosystem to build experiment and respon POS L scale new ideas and approaches IBM and meta launched the AI Alliance in 2023 with the goal to help shape the evolution of AI to best reflect the needs and complexity of our societies llama 3.1 takes an important step in this direction while also providing an unprecedented opportunity to tune and tailor state-of-the-art generative AI models to your specific use case to learn all about the new release check out the link in the description of this video next up the EU AI act entered into force on August 1st making the European Union one of the first major markets to Define new rules around AI as one EU official said the aim is to turn the EU into a global hub for trustworthy AI the AI act takes a risk-based approach meaning that it categorizes applications according to their potential risk to fundamental rights and safety some of the most important Provisions are that the ACT prohibits certain AI practices that are deemed to pose unacceptable risk outline standards for developing and deploying certain high-risk AI system and provides rules for general purpose AI models according to IBM's brunoo it's a form of regulatory pragmatism that aims to adapt constraints with the level of risk the EU AI act will follow a very fast-paced schedule for the full details on what that entails hit the link below to wrap things up today performance testing is crucial to understanding the efficiency of complex applications inside your Cloud hosting environment that's why we're proud to introduce a new Sandbox that uses IBM Cloud virtual servers for VPC we're inviting customers into a non-production environment to test the performance of second gen and fourth gen Intel xon processors across various applications you can choose to Target benchmarks with a Monte Carlos simulation hugging face inference application or Presto data Lake application or if it's more useful you can even bring your own custom application to test for a limited time you can even try try the ibmcloud VPC sandbox and get 100% of your cost reimbursed with ibmcloud credits to learn more hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and of course please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now
