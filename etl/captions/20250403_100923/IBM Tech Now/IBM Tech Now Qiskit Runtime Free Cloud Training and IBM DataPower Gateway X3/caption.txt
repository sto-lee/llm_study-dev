kiskit runtime free courses from the ibm center for cloud training and the ibm data power gateway x3 all on this episode of ibm tech now what's up y'all my name is ian and i am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements about ibm technology last week the ibm quantum team announced two significant updates to the kiskit runtime programming environment what does kisskit you ask it's a hardware agnostic software development kit that gives you the ability to build compile run and analyze quantum circuits and quantum programs it essentially makes it easy to control the interaction between quantum software and quantum hardware but as quantum computing matures the field is increasingly attracting new categories of users such as algorithm developers and application researchers these users want results without getting into the intricacies of hardware or dealing with quantum noise and that's where kiskit runtime comes in released last year it introduces new layers of abstraction that make it easy to access high performance quantum computing systems run quantum circuits at speed and get error mitigated results teams launched a new update of kiskit runtime one that brings an array of novel features and capabilities into two new primitives that will give more programmers an entry point to the service regular kiskit users can also now access our premium quantum systems via ibm cloud with pay-as-you-go pricing so if you're looking for the right time and the best way to dip your toe into quantum programming these two kiskit runtime updates may be just what you need to get started check out the blog post i have linked below for the full details next up there's a worldwide gap in cloud skills for businesses and individuals and 79 percent of companies say they need advanced cloud capabilities for their employees for over 100 years now training and education have been central to ibm's business practice and that's why we're proud to announce that all the ibm cloud courses offered through the ibm center for cloud training are available at no charge that's right free the center for cloud training offers role-based training and certifications like cloud architect cloud developer and cloud sre you can also work towards specialty certifications and security financial services satellite and devsecops our programs are designed for large-scale on-demand worldwide upskilling and we're excited to help it professionals hone their skills advance their careers and help their organizations thrive to learn more hit the link below finally to wrap things up this episode i'm excited to announce the newest generation of data power gateway appliances with the ibm datapower gateway x3 this latest model continues the long line of application gateways from ibm building on the capabilities for securing integrating and automating business and it applications and services the new x3 is designed to extend ibm datapower's capabilities with improved performance security and usability features x3 also equips businesses with a powerful application gateway to protect control optimize integrate and automate their modern traditional and hybrid cloud workloads to learn more about this new model and the timing of the launch check out the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of ibm tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics i've covered make sure you explore the links in the description in this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in tech now you
