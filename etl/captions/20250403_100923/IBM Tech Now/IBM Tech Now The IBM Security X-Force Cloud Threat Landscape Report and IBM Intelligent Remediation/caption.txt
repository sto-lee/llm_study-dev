the cloud threat landscape report and the introduction of IBM intelligent remediation all on this episode of IBM Tech now what's up y'all my name is Ian and I am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements about IBM technology cyber security is a business imperative failing to manage threats can result in costly data leaks lost customer loyalty and even legal action to build a more agile defense against the constantly evolving landscape of cyber threats you'll need the most up-to-date information available that's why we're excited for the release of the IBM X-Force Cloud threat landscape report which analyzes real-world cyber security incidents over the preceding 12 months to provide practical defense strategies and invaluable insights let's look at a few of the key findings first misuse of legitimate credentials is the most used security exploit in fact incident response data shows that 36 percent of incidents involve the misuse of valid credentials should come as no surprise then that the report found that the dark web is teeming with stolen Cloud credentials stolen credentials accounted for nearly 95 percent of cloud assets available on the dark web at an average sale price of only 10.68 the report also found that discoverability and disclosure of vulnerabilities are on the rise IBM X-Force tracks 632 unique cloud-related common vulnerabilities and exposures or cves in the 12 months before the report that's a 194 increase from the prior year in other words Cloud CVS have nearly tripled year over year these are just a few of the main findings of the cloud threat landscape report to read the report and get the full rundown check out the link in the description of this video next up it incidents are bad for business and can result in poor customer experiences and cost organizations millions of dollars in fact an IDC survey found that the most common estimate for an hour of downtime for a revenue generating service was between a hundred thousand and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in today's fast-paced digital environment traditional ticket-based incident response processes may not be fast enough to meet the businesses demands businesses need a new approach one that can help accelerate response times and leverage Automation in AI for incident remediation that's why we're thrilled to introduce a new way to help accelerate incident remediation with IBM intelligent remediation this new capability is planned for use with both IBM and Stana and IBM AI Ops insights it also leverages IBM Watson X solutions to guide and automate incident remediation by providing operations teams with recommended actions to diagnose and remediate the incident it even provides the ability to execute those actions using automation tools like red hat ansible IBM intelligent remediation is designed to provide out-of-the-box automation tools and it leverages Watson xcode assistant for assisted tailoring and creation of additional remediation and diagnostic data collection actions simply put IBM intelligent remediation presents options and gives you automation tools to implement the recommended actions this enables operations to rapidly address incidents and accelerate response times to learn more hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now
