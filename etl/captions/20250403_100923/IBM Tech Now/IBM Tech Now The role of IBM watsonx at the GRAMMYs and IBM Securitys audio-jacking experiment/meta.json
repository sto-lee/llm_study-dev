What's up y'all my name is Ian and I am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and \nannouncements about IBM technology IBM watsonx recently partnered with the recording Academy \nfor the 66th annual Grammy Awards. The challenge they faced? Driving captivating content across multiple digital channels in today's highly fragmented media landscape. Not an easy task when you need to celebrate the achievements and stories of more than a thousand nominees across nearly 100 \ncategories. The solution? AI stories with IBM watsonx, a generative AI content engine fueled by trusted data. Essentially the task was to build a content supply chain that would save hundreds of hours of research, writing and production time while offering creative flexibility and easy review This year's solution used the generative AI capabilities of watsonx to leverage a powerful large language model hosted in the Watsonx.ai component. The model was trained on the recording Academy's trusted \nproprietary data. The AI stories interface let editorial team members choose templates that featured nominees or categories with a variety of layouts and branding. Next they selected an artist or award category to feature the subject of the post and any topics to exclude from the output. AI stories were then created featuring introductory texts, headlines, bullets, one- liners and wrap-up texts. Any of these outputs could be regenerated to create alternate phrasings and could be manually edited easily. And that's how IBM  watsonx and the Recording Academy digital team delivered an engrossing digital experience to more than 5 million music fans worldwide. To learn more about watsonx at the Grammy Awards, click the link in the description of this video. Next up is a wild story about how the IBM security team recently conducted successful audio jacking experiments. It sounds like something out of a movie taking place in the future, but audio jacking intercepts and hijacks a live conversation then uses an LLM to understand the conversation in order to manipulate audio output that clones the victim's voice. Essentially they were able to modify the details of a live Financial conversation occurring  between the two speakers and divert money to a fake adversarial account. It works roughly like this: the attacker installs malware on a victim's phone or compromises a wireless voiceover IP service. Next, they utilize speech to text capabilities to convert the victim's voice and conversation into text and allow the LLM to understand the context of the conversation. Then they instruct the LLM to modify the sentence whenever anyone mentions a bank account. When the LLM modifies the sentence, the program uses text to speech with pre-cloned voices to generate and play the audio - and before you bump on the clone voices, nowadays they only \nneed 3 seconds of an individual's voice to clone  it. Finally, the bot switches the victim's bank account number with their attacker's number so funds are deposited into the wrong account. And just like that, the bot which is acting as a middleman has hijacked the conversation and changed key elements without either of the victims knowing. There's many more fine-tuned details to the whole process that are covered in the blog, but it's another illustration of how security processes will need to continually evolve as gen AI presents new opportunities for bad faith actors to strike.
