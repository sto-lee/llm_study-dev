it is that time of year again think 2023 is here and I'm going to be covering the big announcement coming out of the event Watson X and its three main components all on this episode of IBM Tech now what's up y'all my name is Ian and I am back to bring you the latest and greatest news and announcements about IBM technology if you checked out any of the keynote addresses from this year's IBM think event you've already heard about the exciting introduction of Watson X for decades IBM has been at the Forefront of breakthroughs in Ai and we know that AI is already driving results for business we also believe it is time to place the power of AI in the hands of all kinds of AI Builders from data scientists to developers to Everyday users who have never written a single line of code Watson X is IBM's Next Generation AI platform and it's designed to do just that it provides self-service access to high quality trustworthy data this enables users to collaborate on a single platform where they can build and refine both new generative AI Foundation models and traditional machine Learning Systems Watson X helps facilitate the entire data and AI lifecycle from data preparation to model development deployment and monitoring and we believe it has the potential to scale and accelerate the impact of the most advanced AI on every Enterprise Watson X has three components and I want to dive a bit deeper into each one first is Watson x dot AI an AI Studio designed for the business of today and tomorrow watsonnext.ai combines the capabilities of IBM Watson Studio to build run and deploy AI based machine learning with the latest generative AI capabilities that Leverage The Power of foundation models as AI becomes more pervasive businesses need to feel confident in their models Watson x.ai provides that essential level of trust and gives users access to high quality pre-trained and proprietary IBM Foundation models for Enterprise additionally for AI to be truly transformative as many people as possible should have access to its benefits we made sure that Watson x dot AI is not just for data scientists and Developers business users can also access it via an easy to use interface that responds to natural language prompts for different tasks the second component is watsonx.data which allows businesses to quickly connect to data get trusted insights and reduce data warehouse costs it's a data store built on an open lake house architecture and it runs both on-premises and across multi-cloud environments optimized for all data analytics and AI workloads Watson x.data combines the flexibility of a data lake with the performance of a data warehouse helping businesses to scale data analytics and AI anywhere their data resides users can access data through a single point of entry with a shared metadata layer across clouds and on-prem environments watsonnext.data even comes with built-in governance security and automation the third and final component is Watson x dot governance simply put the more AI is embedded into daily workflows the more you need proactive governance watsonex.governance can help build the necessary guard rails around AI tools and the uses of AI it's an automated data and model lifecycle solution for creating policies assigning decision rights and ensuring organizational accountability for risk and investment decisions by providing the mechanisms to help secure and protect customer privacy and proactively detect model bias and drift Watson x.governance helps organizations meet ethic standards proactively manage risk and reputation and comply with regulatory requirements to sum things up IBM has designed Watson X to adhere to the core principles of trust while being as accessible as possible a future where trustworthy AI delivers boost to productivity and enhances Innovation is not only possible it's already here let's put AI to work and make the world work better to learn more about Watson X and its components hit the links in the description of this video thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now
