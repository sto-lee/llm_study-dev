IBM Watson X at the Masters bring your own model capabilities on Watson x. and the 2023 IBM impact report all on this episode of IBN Tech [Music] now at the Masters story tradition meets state-of-the-art technology through a partnership spanning more than 25 years IBM has helped the August National Golf Club capture analyze distribute and use data to bring fans closer to the action culminating in the AI powered Master's digital experience and mobile app the Masters has long relied on IBM to manage its data application and workloads across on premises servers and multiple clouds but this year marks an important Evolution the entire AI life cycle was managed on the AI and data platform IBM Watson X there are many different intricate facets of this AI life cycle but essentially it began with Watson x. data collecting a massive amount of data before preparing and annotating it then Watson x. a was used to develop evaluate train and test machine learning and generative AI models after tuning and testing the models Watson x. a provided a variety of ways to deploy them to production and evaluate models within the deployment space finally watsen x.g governance provided automated monitoring of deployed machine learning and generative AI models and facilitated transparent explainable results the result was a seamless experience at one of the best sporting events of the year to dive deeper into the technology and what went on behind the scenes click the link in the description of this video next up since its release in July 2023 IBM Watson x. has been enabling businesses to train validate tune and deploy AI models now we're excited to announce a new feature update to Watson x. a that delivers an open framework through a bring your own model capability there are many reasons to import a custom Foundation model all driven by the unique needs of your organization in addition to working with Foundation models that are curated by IBM including open source third party and IBM developed Watson x foundation models you can now upload and deploy your own custom Foundation model to accomplish a range of industry or domain specific generative AI tasks once the model is imported and deployed you can interact with it as you would with other models in the Watson x. Studio you can also leverage it within your applications and have access to the plat form's Enterprise ready governance features the best part is that with the on premises solution you're bringing the model closer to where your data resides mitigating your risk exposure to learn more about bring your own model on Watson x. hit the link below to wrap things up IBM continues to be a leader in driving sustainability for our business our communities and our clients and the release of the 2023 IBM impact report is a continuation of a 34-year history of annual public environmental reporting as a part of our Environmental Management System we have established 21 goals around energy and climate change conservation and biodiversity pollution prevention and Waste Management areas we continue to make progress towards these goals in the 2023 impact report Flex among the findings we reduced our energy use by 6.6% in 2023 from 2022 we implemented 675 new energy conservation projects across more than locations we increase cooling efficiency of our data centers by 16.4% versus 2019 and we increase the use of renewable electricity which now represents 70.6% of the electricity used in IBM operations to learn more and download the report hit the link below thanks so much for joining me today for this episode of IBM Tech now if you're interested in learning more about the topics I've covered make sure you explore the links in the description of this video and again please don't forget to subscribe to our Channel this stay up to date on what's going on in Tech now [Music]
