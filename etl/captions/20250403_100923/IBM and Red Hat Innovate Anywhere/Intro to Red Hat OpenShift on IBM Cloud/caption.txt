Hi everyone, my name is Sai Vennam and I'm with the IBM Cloud team. Today let's talk about Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. First, we'll introduce OpenShift. OpenShift is an open source application platform based on Kubernetes and container technology. It focuses on making the Kubernetes experience easier for developers, as well as operations teams. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud allows you to focus on managing and developing your application. Let us take care of the heavy lifting with the infrastructure, allowing you to create a highly available and managed OpenShift cluster with the click of a button. Together, OpenShift and IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a perfect match, providing you with an industry-leading developer experience. For one, you will get automated provisioning, updates and patching, as well as 24/7 global support. Currently we manage over 14,000 production clusters in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. In addition, you can resiliency and security across the board. Take advantage of highly available masters to administer your clusters and use options for dedicated computing resources and bare metal. With multizone regions, you get stability across data centers - further enhancing your  HA story. On the security front, you get compliance out-of-the-box with things like HIPAA and GDPR. Finally, you get push-button integrations with the entire suite of IBM and Red Hat middleware. Build beyond those basics, and start taking advantage of high value services, like AI and Hyperledger capabilities. With Red Hat and IBM together, we're building out a unified open hybrid cloud platform. Whether you're running on-premises, or in the cloud, taking advantage of Kubernetes, OpenShift, serverless, or CF technology, IBM Cloud is unifying these choices and bringing them under one management platform powered by open container technologies. With the unified Red Hat and IBM Cloud platform, start planning your open hybrid cloud strategy today.
