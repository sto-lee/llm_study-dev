start with Developers one of the key features that openshift is going to give us is speed of development particularly with the steps of creating and building the cloud native application which is you know manifested as containers and the feature in openshift that makes that possible is called source to image so let's look at how sourced the image works first your developer is going to write some code and they're going to put it in a git Repository and this is where sourced image is going to take over sourced image is going to be able to look at the code that was placed in the repository and it's going to be able to determine did you write Java code did you write python code and it's going to be able to recognize what type of code you wrote and since you wrote some code it's now smart enough to know what type of Base image that you need to pick and it's going to go pull that from an image catalog so now what source damage is going to do it's going to take the code that you wrote it's going to combine it with the base image that was appropriate for whether you wrote python or whether you wrote Java and it's going to build a new image and it's going to put that new image in a registry it's going to push your new image to a registry and then when it's ready to deploy it's gonna push that image to deploy to deployment so what happened here why was this such a great feature well a lot of these steps here uh the selecting of an image and merging that image with code and building a new image typically you have to write a container script building files sometimes called Docker files to do all those steps and if you're someone like myself who's been writing these types of container building files for years those steps aren't too hard but if you have a lot of new Developers you know Java developers python developers who've been developing for years but aren't very familiar with Cloud native applications and how to do container type activities building containers and picking an image and putting it and merging it with the image with the code that they wrote and then pushing it to a registry having openshift automate all of that for you is is a huge help so that's a key feature for new developers that openshift provides and another feature that openshift provides is easy networking through the use of routes so in vanilla kubernetes the networking piece is really complicated and can be very hard to do and what's really nice about openshift is it takes care of the networking piece for you so what it'll give you is it'll give you an easy to read URL that maps to your deployed application and then the other aspect that the openshift will provide you networking wise is integration with external load balancers so it allow it'll take care of that integration with the external load balancer and even give you different load balancing options and if you had to figure all that out in vanilla kubernetes you'd have to be really strong in kubernetes networking to be able to perform those activities so now let's move on and talk about what does openshift do for you from an IT operations perspective and we're going to talk about that under the context of day two operations and so the key piece that openshift gives you for your day two operations is automation so what does openshift automate for you well the first thing it automates for you are installs and then the next big piece that it provides automation for are updates and the updates aren't simple updates so when it doesn't update it worries about updating the platform which is openshift and it also updates the underlying operating system which is Rel now why it's important to update both of these together is openshift will always make sure that the version of openshift is compatible with the version of the operating system that's being used you'll never run into incompatibility issues because the wrong OS version was picked further for the particular version of openshift so it's a key feature in the automated updates that openshift provides another place where openshift provides automation is in cluster size so in vanilla kubernetes if your cluster is not big enough it's really hard to increase the size of the cluster but in openshift it's able to do this automatically for you so it's a huge benefit if you're running out of you know you have scalability issues and you don't have enough nodes in your cluster having this taken care of by openshift is going to be a huge help to your it operations folks the next feature that openshift provides you is multi-cloud management so when you start running in production the odds are you're going to be running lots of clusters and you're probably going to be running them on different clouds maybe different types of clouds public clouds private clouds and try to manage all those clusters running on all those different Cloud environments and vanilla kubernetes is really difficult but openshift has built-in tools for multi-cloud management that make running across multiple clouds very very easy it's all built into the tool now the last piece where open shift really shines is insecurity and the aspects of security that openshift really shines is in two pieces one is in guard rails and what do we mean by guard rails so openshift essentially prevents you from running with Scissors so if you have new developers new folks that are deploying to production there are some things that vanilla kubernetes will let you do that you really should never do in production so one example of this is running a privileged container a container that runs as root you never want to run those in production uh you know if you're worried about security because there's a big surface area that can be attacked with vulnerabilities if you're running as root so what openshift will do is it will prevent you from running that type of container it'll request that the container be non-privileged another example of of a particular vulnerability that openshift gives you guard rails for is if you use a default namespace again using a default namespace can have security vulnerabilities and openshift is going to make sure that whenever you deploy your container that you are using non-default namespace now the last aspect of security that openshift takes care of is the notion of profiles so in vanilla kubernetes there's a large number of knobs that you have to turn to get security right so and there's not a lot of people that are very comfortable with turning all those knobs correctly to make sure there's no security vulnerabilities in openshift you don't have to modify the individual knobs instead what you do is you pick a particular security context constraint profile and the profile that you pick will give you the level of security and the level of access that your container needs but it's also going to take care of turning all those knobs the right way so you never have to personally turn those knobs and you can feel more comfortable that you just picked a profile and that profile is proven to be secure so what have we seen today we've seen that openshift provides us great benefits for day two operations and it also provides us great benefits to developers and speeds up their development and this is why we feel openshift provides a lot of value Beyond vanilla kubernetes thanks for watching if you enjoyed this content please like the video and subscribe to our Channel"
