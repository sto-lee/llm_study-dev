We complete 13 Billion API calls. We do 100 Million page views daily. There is a lot of overhead and upkeep. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is fully managed\nnative OpenShift environment where we are providing highly available masters, multizone\nclusters, integrating with platform services such as identity and access management, monitoring\nand logging, and key protect. It is the same OpenShift that I'm familiar\nwith and love so much, but the moment we moved into the IBM Cloud all I had to worry about\nwas my worker nodes. That was nice. In terms of DevOps, the key benefit of using\na managed Kubernetes Service is that it allows our customers to focus on innovation\nand delivering software faster for their customers. Using a managed Kubernetes service has resulted\nin a 80% improvement in efficiency in my workloads and my team's workloads because now we are\nfocused on what The Weather Company needs us to focus on instead of all this infrastructure\nthat provided no direct benefit. Together Red Hat and IBM are dedicated to\nimproving the DevOps experience of using Kubernetes."
