Well, \nlet's start by getting a few things straight.   The models we're talking about in this video, \nthey're specifically LLMs, and that's large   language models, which are foundation models \nthat use artificial intelligence, deep learning   and massive datasets to generate text. We're \ntalking generative AI. And there are two types of   generative AI models: There's proprietary models, \nand there are open source models. Now, proprietary   LLMs, those are owned by a company who can control \nits usage. A proprietary LLM may include a license   that restricts how the LLM can be used. On \nthe other hand, open source LLMs are free and   available for anyone to access, and developers and \nresearchers are free to use, improve or otherwise   modify the model. Now look, it's not true in every \ninstance, but generally many proprietary LLMs are   far larger in size than open source models. And \nspecifically in terms of parameter size. Some of   the leading proprietary LLMs extend to thousands \nof billions of parameters. Probably? Actually,   we don't necessarily know because, well, those \nLLMs and that parameter counts are proprietary.   But bigger isn't necessarily better. And the \nopen source model ecosystem is showing promise   in challenging the proprietary LLM business model. \nSo let's discuss the benefits of open source LLMs.   Let's talk about the types of organizations \nthat are using them. Let's talk about some of   the leading open source models available today, \nand we should talk about the risks associated   with using them. Now, clearly, one of the \nbenefits of a open source large language model,   that has to be transparency. Open source LLMs \nmay offer better insight into how they work,   their architecture, and the training data used to \ndevelop them. Another big one is pre-trained open   source LLMs allow a process called fine tuning. \nThat means you can add features to the LLM that   benefit your specific use case and the LLMs \ncan be trained on specific data sets. So I can   fine tune an LLM with my own data. And community \ncontributions are a big plus. Using a proprietary   LLM means you're reliant on a single provider, \nwhereas open source models benefit from community   contributions and multiple service providers. You \ncan experiment and use contributions from people   with varying perspectives. And these benefits \nhave led to all sorts of organizations to use   open source LLMs. In another video, I addressed \nhow NASA and IBM developed an open source LLM   trained on geospatial data. Some healthcare \norganizations use open source LLMs for diagnostic   tools and treatment optimization. There's an open \nsource LLM called FinGPT [fin / financial]. It was   developed for the financial industry. Which brings \nus onto the topic of talking about some specific   open source LLMs that you might find of interest. \nNow Huggingface maintains an open LLM leaderboard,   and that tracks , ranks, and evaluates open \nsource LLMs on various benchmarks like which LLM   is scoring highest on the Truthful AI Benchmark \nseries, which measures whether a language model   is truthful in generating answers to questions. So \nit gives those answers a score. And the top spots   on this leaderboard, they change frequently. \nAnd it's quite fun to watch the progress these   models are making. Many of the models on the \nleaderboard are variations on the Llama 2 open   source LLM. That's the one provided by Meta \nAI. And Llama 2 encompasses pre-trained and   fine tuned generative text models from 70 billion \nall the way down to 7 billion parameters. And it's   licensed for commercial use. Vicuna was created \non top of the Llama model and fine tuned to follow   instructions. And then it's also Bloom by BigScience, which is a multilingual language model   created by more than 1000 AI researchers. Now, one \narea that both proprietary and open source LLMs   share is their associated risks. Although LLM \noutputs often sounds fluent and authoritative,   they can be confidently wrong. Hallucinations, \nthey can result from the LLM being trained on   incomplete, contradictory, or inaccurate data \nfrom misunderstanding context. Bias happens   when the source of data is not diverse or not \nrepresentative. And security problems can include   leaking PII, and cybercriminals using the LLMs for \nmalicious tasks like phishing. Especially in these   early days of large language models, we do need to \nmitigate risk. But open source LLMs are thriving   in business. Here at IBM, the Watsonx.ai Studio \nmakes available access to multiple Llama 2 models,   and IBM has released a series of foundation \nmodels of its own called Granite. And this   space is changing rapidly, making open source \nLLMs a field well-worth keeping a close eye on."
