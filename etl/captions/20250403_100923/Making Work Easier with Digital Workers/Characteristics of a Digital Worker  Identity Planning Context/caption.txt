a digital employee can help you get work done faster it helps you with repetitive mundane tasks so you can focus on the bigger picture having a digital employee is like having your own sidekick an executive assistant or a new teammate that is trained to do a specific set of tasks imagine having your own intelligent digital worker that just for you and your team that can do things for you like generate a monthly report or onboard a new teammate or onboard a new vendor how much time would you save how much more productive would you be but how would it work and how is it different from a conventional software robot I'm Leslie Chao product manager at IBM Automation and today we're going to open up the hood and peek in but before we dive in if you like this video or want to see more like it please like And subscribe there are three key characteristics that make a digital employee effective at helping you and your team do work and that's identity context and planning let's start with identity a digital employee has a name and a profile in your work directory it has ID and login credentials and that's really important for two key reasons for the first having a name and profile also means it has a drop profile and specific things that it does in the company that allows folks in your team to be able to know to go to the digital employee for specific asks just like with your human colleagues you know to go to Bob for HR things and Sally for finance things the second reason is security with access and ID comes Access Control this allows you to secure and protect your business systems and provide your digital employee access to specific Business Systems and specific applications and data so that you can protect those next let's go to context context and memory gives your digital employee context of what you do as a business as well as a conversation that you and your colleagues are having with it that's really important for two reasons one it makes the conversation flow much more naturally that way it remembers when you when you're having the conversations or asks that you're giving in so that way you're not spending more time asking and typing and explaining yourself then just doing it yourself so you can say something like generated financial report and then say send it it the digital employee has context and memory of the conversation that's had with you so it knows that it is the financial report and to send it by email second reason is it understands your asks better so that you can say things whether it's create a report or generate a report or generate a statement you know that those mean the same thing to you and the employee also knows those would mean the same thing it means generate the financial report last but not least is planning planning is what makes a digital employee special the digital employee has AI that allows it to generate a plan or plans to accomplish a specific goal so when you ask it to do something like generate a monthly financial report it looks into its repository skills that you gave it and come up with a plan or plans to accomplish that goal for example the digital employee can look into The Ledger database directly it can generally report in Salesforce or maybe it will look into a Dropbox folder to see if someone else has already put it there it will present this these options to you and give you a recommended amended options and let you decide how you would want to generate a monthly financial report so there you have it digital employees have identity context and plan thank you if you like this video and want to see more like it please like And subscribe if you have questions please drop them in the comments below
