I see what's an orchestrate changing the concepts of the future of work so this new kind of concept of digital workers um is a really it's a new definition of it so people when you talk to them about digital workers do they mean a chatbot do they mean a robot and I think up until very recently that was basically what most of us thought the New Concept of digital worker that we're now really evolving using this tool called Watson orchestrate is something very different to that and imagine it's like you getting somebody new in your team the old kind of digital worker through chat would do one thing and one thing well so it would answer a query it would maybe find your policy May simplify a task through chat but as soon as you switched it off it would forget you ever existed digital worker doesn't and that's the big big shift now something like Watson orchestrate brings is it has a memory and it can remember and it can learn and nothing I've ever seen has ever done that before it took us a while to get our head round the shift in thinking around it's a digital worker that's different than a chatbot or a robot once they taught us that difference it that the ideas that we had just kind of exploded it was like this is different and therefore instead of it doing one thing at a time we could get it to run and manage a program they were really interested in saying can this digital worker come in and automate the bits that a manual do all the high volume stuff take away the admin that actually they felt was adding no value when they did themselves as humans but one really interesting thing that we learned when we got managers to try this in our production system was they said oh this is really cool we love this it's it's making our life easier it's simplifying it's helping us make better decisions and the manager said this gives us information that we can go back to our employees and Coach them better than we've everyone else to do so here was making a huge kind of difference around efficiency and effectiveness is doing a big leap in experience for managers Talent Partners the workday Coe Etc but it's also making managers better coaches and that's the bit we had no idea was going to do that there is no reason whatsoever why exactly the same thing can't happen in finance while you can't have a digital worker do a quote to class process we know that sales is a great opportunity where a sales administrator through a digital worker will bring information to a salesperson when they need it where they need it in whatever order they need it and we'll go off and coordinate to whole series of activities and background to the salesperson just needs to sell the workforce challenge is always too busy doing stuff to be strategic and get ready for the future orchestrate will help us stop having to do stuff and allow us to think a lot more
