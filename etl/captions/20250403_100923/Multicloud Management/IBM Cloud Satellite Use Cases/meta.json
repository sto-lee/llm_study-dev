Today, many enterprises are benefiting from using \npublic cloud to build and run their applications.   Being able to consume IT as a service, through \nAPIs, at scale, and as needed has transformed how   applications are built. Public Cloud enabled \ncompanies to innovate in new, faster ways. But the reality is only somewhere between   5% and 20% of enterprise workloads have moved \nto the cloud. That first wave of applications   were focused mostly on new workloads \nor workloads that can easily relocate.   Many applications have requirements around \nsecurity, compliance, latency, regulation,   and performance that mean those workloads can't \neasily move into a public cloud. Enterprises need   an ability to gain the benefits of public cloud \nanywhere they need their applications to run.     What would help these enterprises is \nsomething called Distributed Cloud.  Distributed cloud is a new cloud computing \nmodel that extends public cloud services   to any location. This means companies \ncan now run not only in their primary   cloud provider's infrastructure but on \npremises, in other cloud providers',   in third party data centers or colocation \ncenters, or at the edge - in factories,   distribution centers, stores, hospitals \nand ports - with everything managed from a   single control plane. IBM Cloud Satellite is \nour new distributed cloud capability. With   Satellite you can take advantage of the \ncatalog of services from IBM cloud with   industry optimized security and compliance \nand leading AI capabilities anywhere you   need it. All with a common API, user experience, \nmanagement dashboard and user consumption model.   To see how IBM Cloud Satellite works, let’s \ntake a look at a couple of real-world examples. We’ll start with the financial services \nindustry.  On the surface, the financial   services industry might seem like it's all about \nmoney, but it's really all about technology. In   order to compete, financial institutions \nneed to create exceptional user experiences.    To do that, they leverage AI and trading \nalgorithms to stay ahead of the market. To be competitive financial services clients \nneed to iterate quickly and leverage cloud-native   tools and best practices. However, the financial \nindustry is heavily regulated. So, they need to   be able to keep that data secure and compliant \n- which often means there are restrictions on   where that data can live. IBM Cloud Satellite \ncan help solve this conflict.  These financial   services companies can now extend public cloud \nservices in their data centers, allowing them   to leverage cloud native best practices and meet \ntheir security and compliance obligations, all at   the same time. So, Satellite enables you to take \nadvantage of a public cloud consumption model,   but in many different locations - and you don't \nhave to be an expert in running these software   stacks to run them outside of the public \ncloud. Let's take a look at another example,   this time in the construction \nindustry, where worker safety is key.   One of our clients is leveraging distributed \nanalytics to keep workers safe.   In this scenario, you might have a business, or \nan office building that is under construction,   and you need to be able to leverage video \nanalytics to tell if someone is wearing a hard   hat or not - and warn them before they move into \na potentially dangerous area of that building.  They want to use video analytics to \nautomatically detect this situation,   but latency could be a real problem - if you \nwarn someone too late they could be injured. So, let's take a look at how \nthis scenario might work. To solve this safety problem, you need to be able \nto analyze video data from many cameras all over   the office building, but it's impractical to send \nall of that data back to the cloud to be processed   remotely. It would be better if the video \nprocessing happened close to the actual device.   Traditionally, that would require you to install \nservers and software and manage them on-prem.   With IBM Cloud Satellite, we can extend \nthe public cloud into the office,   so we can leverage cloud services to run \nthis application close to the device - and   that's critical in ensuring that we can \nreduce latency and effectively warn someone   before they enter a dangerous \narea.That same client in this   worker safety scenario had to adjust to \nchallenges brought by the Covid pandemic. They were able to quickly iterate on \ntheir application and modify the use-case.   Now, instead of warning workers about \nwearing hard hats, they can make sure   that workers are wearing masks and ensure \nthat the masks are being worn correctly.   They can even leverage thermal devices to \ntake temperatures. With IBM Cloud Satellite,   you can quickly address unforeseen challenges, \nleverage cloud benefits in any location,   and innovate quickly. Anytime. Anywhere. thank you \nfor watching if you have questions please drop us   a line below if you want to see more videos like \nthis in the future please like and subscribe"
