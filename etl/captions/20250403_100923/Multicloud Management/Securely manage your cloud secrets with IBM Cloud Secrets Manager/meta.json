But, before I get into it, don't \nforget to hit that \"Subscribe\" button!   As enterprises build more microservices and become \nglobally distributed, securing your application   secret data becomes much more complex. As we saw \nbefore in my previous video, secrets management   services enable the secure management of digital \ncredentials that ultimately allow entities   to securely interact with services.IBM Cloud \nSecrets Manager is a service based on open-source   HashiCorp Vault designed to securely manage \nthe lifecycle of Secrets, such as IAM API Keys,   User credentials, or different forms of arbitrary \ntext. This allows IT security leaders to dream big   about their cloud native application future \nwithout being concerned about data breaches   from mismanaged credentials, or losing velocity in \ntheir developer operations while securing secrets.   Secrets Manager centralizes the experience \nof generating, storing, rotating, and revoking   multiple types of secrets from a single pane \nof glass. Integrations with other services such   as your private catalogs in IBM Cloud enables \nthe retrieval of your secrets in-context when   you need them, streamlining your workflows.  \nThrough leasing, it even allows for you to give   an application or a team member temporary access \nto a service to complete their respective task.   As a managed service, Secrets Manager offers much \nof the same benefit of an on-premise deployment of   Vault without the hassle of having to maintain its \ntricky operators, or manage and ultimately operate   its underlying infrastructure. This allows you \nto keep your desired security posture at scale,   while we take care of the rest. A critical element \nof Secrets Manager that makes it’s so powerful   is its unique trust model. Built for enterprises \nthat have very little tolerance for any sort of   data vulnerabilities but need the velocity \nprovided by the cloud.  This model starts by   allowing you to seal your vault and encrypt all of \nyour hosted secrets with your own root encryption   key. For example — one of your existing \nFIPS compliant keys from IBM Key Protect,   giving you ownership of your data. Next, your data \nis protected in transit through TLS — Your vault   as well as the UI and APIs you use to interact \nwith it are all single-tenant. Meaning, your   data is isolated in your own dedicated silo and \ndoesn’t rely on any shared components. And…should   you decide to delete your instance you have the \npeace of mind that your data is cryptographically   deleted. Thanks for listening to this introduction \nof IBM Cloud Secrets Manager. To get started   with improving the security of your secrets \ncome check us out in the IBM Cloud catalog."
