Multicloud is a cloud computing approach made\nup of 2 or more cloud environments. Let's get started. So, we've got a public environment here as\nwell as a private cloud. There's an important distinction to be made here: multicloud is not exactly the same thing as hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud implies that your workloads are\nworking together across multiple clouds - so interoperability and portability of your workloads. Multicloud doesn't have that same requirement, but we are seeing that a lot of enterprise users and customers are using multi and hybrid cloud strategy together. I'd say that the growth of containers and\nKubernetes technology has really enabled the growth of multicloud. So, we're seeing almost every big cloud provider\nout there providing managed Kubernetes, as well as it being used on-premises in the private sector to help modernize legacy applications. So, why would you want to use multicloud and\nthe strategy for your cloud computing? Well, there's a number of reasons. For one, let's say that you want to hit that\nbig three-nines number as far as availability goes. Multicloud strategy can help you hit that\nby ensuring that, you know, it's one thing when the clouds of one of your application\nworkloads stops to work you still have another cloud that's supporting your applications. In addition, you can enable better user experience. So, let's say you have users on different\nsides of the globe. By routing them to the cloud that's nearest\nto them, you can ensure lower latency and better user experiences. Finally, what about specific integrations\nthat only work on a particular clouds? Say you have some sensitive firewall data\nthat you don't want to put in the public cloud, but you need to build integrations for. By taking advantage of a multicloud approach,\nyou can build workloads on the private side that can take advantage of that private, sensitive,\ncustomer data. I'd say there's 3 major ways and things that\nyou want to tackle when taking on a multicloud strategies, and I'm gonna introduce these\nas three pillars. The first one is gonna be automation. So, to do this I, let me introduce kind two\ndifferent types of users: so, we've got Ops, as well as Devs. So, operations engineers are going to want\nto be able to spin up new clusters as well as manage and, kind of, see the different\nclusters that have been created. So, they're gonna want to take advantage of\na unified, kind of, dashboard to do something like that. So, we'll have the control plane here. Let's say the ops engineers want to spin up\ntwo Kubernetes clusters. So, they'll essentially figure out that configuration,\nand then go to the control panel, and tell it to spin up those clusters. At that point you know they can specify where\nthey want those clusters to be created. Let's say they spin up two. Kubernetes clusters, one in each of the clouds. On, the other side with devs, let's say that\nthey've built out a new application, a Docker container, and they're ready to push it. So, they've got a container built, and they\nwanted to deploy it the same way to both of the clouds but you know it can be quite difficult\nif they didn't have a control plane to figure out the different authentications and configurations\nof the unique different clouds and kind of deploy that both times. In addition, this really gets in the way of\ntraditional kind of CICD and DevOps workflows. So, by taking advantage of that control plane,\nthey can spin up that container in both of the clouds with a single command. Say that it's application 'A'. So, I think that really hits this requirement\nfor automation with multicloud. The next kind of requirement that I want to\nhit on here is visibility. Visibility is very important for working with\nmultiple clouds because, you know, they each have their own unique dashboards but to have\na single unified way of managing those things is very important. So, for operations engineers, by taking advantage\nof a single control dashboard, they can have access to a unified kind of approach and see\nall the different, you know, clusters that they've spun up and even drill down deeper\nand see things like pods and deployments in applications across multiple clouds. The last thing I want to touch on, the last\npillar, is governance. These days regulatory and compliance policies\nare becoming increasingly strict and they differ from geography to geography. Let's say the operations team has a compliance\npolicy that they want to push out across all of these clouds. So, first they'll have to, you know, write\nout that compliance policy, and then, you know, if they didn't have access to a control\nplane, this can be a very kind of painstaking, or rather time-consuming, approach. So, by taking advantage of the control plane\nthey can push that compliance policy across multiple clusters with a single command and\nensure those security policies for compliance are being met. I'd say that these are the 3 major things\nthat you want to tackle when taking on a multicloud strategy. Multicloud has been a growing focus for us\nhere at IBM.
