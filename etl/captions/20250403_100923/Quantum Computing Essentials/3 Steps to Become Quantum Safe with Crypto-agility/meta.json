In the near future, quantum computers   may be able to crack these encryption algorithms. \nThat's why every organizational leader needs   to understand the risk to their data and the \nsolutions that will make them quantum safe. Let's get to it.  What bad actors and cyber criminals \ncan do once quantum computers mature? First   thing they can do is fraudulent authentication, \nwhich means they can get access to our data--the   secure data that we have in our applications, our \nsystems, and our databases. Second thing they can   do is forge signatures, which means they can fake \nthe records, fake the audits, and also can make   the fake identity and tamper [with] our blockchain \nassets as well. Third thing they can do is harvest   now/decrypt later, which is very, very important \nfor us today. We are understanding that they   cannot steal and decrypt the data today, but they \nwill be sitting on it until the quantum computers   mature and they will be able to decrypt that and \nfind out the crown jewels from your enterprise.   The first step is to discover. Discover your \ncryptography means you need to identify the   cryptography-relevant artifacts in your business \napplications--source code as well as object code.   What this means is that brings you the visibility \nwhere the cryptography function library's methods are being used. Once you have them, \nyou need to also find out the dependencies   across all of these artifacts and then create a \nsingle source of truth. A similar concept like   in a supply chain inventory called SBOM (software \nbill of materials). You need to have the concept   called cryptography bill of materials (CBOM). IBM \nhas been helping bringing that as a standard as   part of the CycloneDX. And this capability can bring \nyou a static view of your business applications   environment. Once you have this, the next step \nis observe. Observe your cryptography means   bringing the dynamic view along with static \nview. Often many organizations have either one   or the other, but you need to have both. And \nas part of bringing both of these together,   you need to have a full inventory of your \ncryptography assets from network perspective as   well as your applications' perspective. And then \nyou need to understand how these key exchanges are   happening from cryptography perspective like TLS, \nSSL from your network environments. And then once   you get the full visibility of that inventory, \nyou need to prioritize where your cryptography   relevant artifacts are important based on \nyour cryptography posture or your regulatory   compliance requirements, and then create \nthat list. And once you have the prioritized   inventory of your cryptography assets, you need \nto transform the cryptography by implementing   and applying the quantum safe algorithms, or \nencryption algorithms, or new certificates,   or key lifecycle management capabilities that are \nquantum safe. By doing this, you need to make sure   that you are also following a process that you \ncan achieve crypto-agility. What we mean by   crypto-agility is that [is] how can you reduce the \nburden on development as well as the operational   environment so that it's not disrupting your \nexisting systems and applications--and rather   giving you an ability to move from old algorithms \nto new algorithms seamlessly, which means you can   have crypto-agility as a service capabilities, \nstarting from encryption, key lifecycle management   and certificate management capabilities that \nwould be quantum safe. And whenever you need   them in your business applications, you can simply \nmake an API call when you need a new encryption,   when you need a new certificate, when you need a \nnew key in general. So this helps you bring a full   capability across Discover, Observe and Transform. \nNow you understand the three key steps. What tools   should we use to get to your journey to quantum \nsafe? IBM Quantum Safe Explorer helps you discover   your cryptography by scanning the source code and \nobject code of your enterprise applications. Also,   it can create and generate the CBOM, what we \ncall the cryptography bill of materials. This   gives you the static view of your IT enterprise \napplications. IBM Quantum Safe Advisor can help   you bring both the static as well as the \ndynamic view of your cryptography assets   and also prioritize them based on the cryptography \nposture in reference to your compliance and the   vulnerabilities. IBM Quantum Safe Remediator \nis a capability that can bring and allow you   to remediate with quantum safe algorithms, \nquantum safe key management capabilities,   as well as the certificate management capabilities \nthat can allow you to be crypto-agile. And there   are a set of remediation patterns that are part \nof Remediator that can enable you based on your   requirements in terms of VPN, in terms of \nproxy, in terms of TLS connections. All   of those remediation patterns are based on \nthe best practices that we know as of now,   based on our current client needs. IBM Quantum \nSafe can help any organization not only prepare   for the post quantum cybersecurity landscape, but \nalso improve and maintain their cyber security   hygiene overall.
