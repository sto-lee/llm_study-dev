today we're going to talk about Quantum Computing applications in chemistry for many years computational chemists have been using classical computational methods to attempt to solve chemistry problems my background is in software development but I'm particularly passionate about the applications of software within chemistry and the particular advantages that Quantum Computing has the potential to bring many computational chemists will use a popular software packages such as gaussian pie SCF and PSI 4. these plus many others all of these different packages provide a suite of tools to enable computational chemists to do research into various different types of chemistry problems and they all use particular sets of of data to be able to do this work and some of the important data points can include information about a molecules ground state energy excited state energy as well as potential energy surfaces um and and many more but how do we actually calculate this information for a given molecule let's take um H2O for example so in order to calculate the ground state energy of water from a classical perspective first we're going to need some information about the molecule itself we want to know the atoms that are involved as well as maybe some different coordinates in space um and as well as this we're also going to take a set of functions known as a basis set which you can think of as essentially a mathematical representation of the different orbitals within the H2O molecule so in order to and then we take this information and what we're going to do is we're going to plug it into a Schrodinger equation uh Schrodinger equation is a very important equation within chemistry and Quantum uh quantum mechanics generally and it defines uh the quantum system itself and this value e here represents the energy of our Quantum system in this case our Quantum system is the H2O molecule so if we minimize this value of E we can get the ground state energy so how do we actually go about finding this minimum value of e well there are a few different things we can do but firstly what we're wanting to do is make some assumptions to simplify the problem of it we can use the born Oppenheimer approximation as well as the Heart Tree  approximation and these assumptions essentially make it easier to compute solutions to this equation and once we've done that our output will be a approximation of that ground state energy um so so far everything we've done up till this point um we can do classically with classical computers um however there are a few problems with this the first one being that um the accuracy of this value will decrease as the complexity of our Quantum system increases um as well as this if we want to do any further processing Beyond Heart Tree fog this becomes exponentially um more uh difficult and computationally very expensive very quickly and this is why software packages like the ones I mentioned before will often leverage gpus and high performance computers in order to try to solve this equation for more complex molecules but quantum computers have the potential to simulate these more complex molecules more efficiently and to a higher degree of accuracy Than Just A Heart Tree fog uh processing and this is because quantum computers process information in a fundamentally uh different way than classical computers do um so let's go back to our Schrodinger equation for a minute we can essentially map this equation onto qubits onto Quantum bits and we can also incorporate some of these approximations as well so we can represent this in Quantum circuit form and because we've done this now we can leverage um key uh Quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement then if we're using kiskit runtime we can take this Quantum circuit and use it together with an estimator primitive as well as an optimizer and we can take all of that and plug it into a variational Quantum eigensolver algorithm this is a very important Quantum Computing algorithm that enables us to calculate eigen eigenvalues efficiently um so if we're and if we're using uh Primitives these are unique to IBM's kiss kit runtime they are predefined programs uh that help users to optimize their workloads and execute them efficiently on Quantum systems the estimator primitive in particular makes it easier to extract solutions from this circuit and also give us incredibly fine-grained control over the system hardware and the optimization routine so we can generate the best results possible um so once we've done all of that we will get an output which is again an approximation of the ground state energy for our H2O molecule um but this uh value that we've calculated here is often more precise than just doing Heart Tree fog uh calculations alone and it doesn't consume compute resources as fast and this is why um Quantum Computing researchers particularly in the field of chemistry are incredibly excited about the potential for quantum computers to have a real impact on the chemistry industry specifically and with open source tools like uh kids kit runtime and kiss kit nature anyone can get started experimenting with this today and we'll leave some links in the description uh for you to get going with that thank you very much I hope you enjoyed this video remember to like subscribe leave any questions that you
