But before you start to panic, while we have\nreal quantum hardware today, it's not quite powerful enough to do that\njust yet. However, technologies are advancing faster\nthan ever. The cell phones we have today are more powerful\nthan the mainframes that we used to send people to the moon. And the researchers believe that we will soon\nbe entering an era of quantum advances where quantum computers will be used to accelerate\nclassical computers, just like GPUs. In this video, I'm going to talk about five\nfoundational topics in quantum computers: superposition, gates, measurement, interference,\nand entanglement. But before we dive into that, let's first talk\nabout bits. Classical computers that use bits which are\nlike switches that can be a 0 or a 1. This way of computation has served us well.\nSo well, in fact, that almost all modern computers work this way. However, this approach doesn't solve all the\nproblems that we have today -- problems that can blow up exponentially and would take a\nclassical computers decades or more to solve. We already talked about the algorithm we\nuse for encryption. Other types of difficult problems include\noptimization, chemistry simulation, and machine learning. Now let's talk about our first topic, superposition. A quantum computer does not use the simple 0\nand 1 bits. Instead, it uses qubits. Qubits can be a 0, a 1, or any linear combination\nof the two. This spectrum of states is what we called\na superposition. Our next next topic is about gates. Similar to classical computers, we use -- we\nstring together qubits using a construct called gates that can alter the states of qubits into\ncircuits. For example, we can have a qubit that's at the state of 0. Then we can use Hadamard gate, or H gate for short,\nto put it in a superposition between 0 and 1. And, of course, you can have multiple qubits\nwith multiple gates in a circuit. For the circuit will be useful, at some point\nthat you need to read about its outputs. Which brings us to our next topic, measurement. When a qubit is measured, it loses its superposition\nand collapses into just a simple 0 or 1. That means an arrow pointing this way does not measure\na 0.5, instead, it has a 50% chance of measuring\na 0 and 50% chance of measuring a 1. It is this in-between state that sometimes\npeople say that a qubit can be a 0 and a 1 at the same time. It also means that just a small number of\nqubits can represent a large amount of information. So for our next topic, interference, we begin by addressing a common problem -- common question -- why is it that quantum\ncomputers can outperform classical ones? So, if you remember, a quantum state is\na linear combination of the 0 state and the 1 state. So, an operation applied to this can be seen\nas applying to the 0 state and the 1 state, doing two calculations at once. It is this parallel computation that gives\nquantum its unique advantage. However, as you may recall, when a qubit is\nmeasured, it loses its superposition and collapses into 0 or 1. That means we can only get a single answer\ninstead of all the answers from this parallel computation. And to make sure the single answer we get\nis a correct one, quantum gates need to be arranged in a way so that it would amplify the correct answer and cancel\nall the incorrect ones. A process called interference. Now this leads us to our last topic, entanglement. When qubits are entangled, their states become\nstrongly correlated. That is, changing the state of just one qubit would change\nthe state of another. For example, we can entangle two qubits so\nthat their states have 50% chance of measuring a 00 and 50% chance of measuring a 11, but\nnever a 01 or a 10. In this case, if we just -- if we change just\nthe state of one, the other one would also change. So with the combined power of superposition, interference, and entanglement, quantum computers can solve things that classical\ncomputers simply cannot do today. It can lead to better drug -- better drug discovery --\nor enhance the stock portfolio or even artificial intelligence. Now we just need to wait for the quantum hardware\nto catch up.
