  "caption": "what if you could elastically combine both Quantum and classical computational resources to accelerate the development of real world applications you're interested in in this video we're going to be talking about Quantum serverless which will hopefully enable you to do this if you've looked at IBM's development roadmap you'll have seen the term quantum serverless what this is is just a development model that lets you seamlessly leverage both classical and Quantum Resources so if you have a cloud with both existing classical resources like CPUs and gpus and then also have Quantum Computing resources what Quantum serverless lets you do is leverage the same interface to orchestrate and provision on demand these different kinds of resources why this is important is if you look at most near-term applications of quantum Computing are you there a hybrid model where they take a Quantum circuit or a Quantum program as an input into a quantum computer and then take the output of that into a classical computer that runs a classical optimization program and feeds back to the next iteration of the loop from that optimization program the problem is to solve real world problems current quantum computers aren't powerful enough this is where something like Quantum serverless could hopefully help in the future where we can take a distributed workflow where we take different kinds or multiple CPUs gpus and even Quantum Resources to hopefully accelerate development of real world applications of potential future use case for this is something called circuit knitting where if you had a Quantum program that was too large for today's Quantum devices you can split it into smaller Quantum programs that are runnable on today's devices and then you combine them with classical processing to simulate what the original circuit would have been the problem with this is It's incredibly computationally intensive to do this process so something like Quantum serverless will help us accelerate what we're able to do with current devices to hopefully develop better Real World applications sooner Quantum serverless is not currently available but keep an eye out for new developments and the introduction of quantum serverless in the meantime you can leverage kiskit runtime to get started with running programs on quantum computers if you have any questions please leave a comment below and don't forget to like And subscribe"
