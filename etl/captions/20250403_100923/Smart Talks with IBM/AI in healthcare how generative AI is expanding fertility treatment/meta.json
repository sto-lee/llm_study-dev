This season, we’re continuing our conversations with New Creators — visionaries who are creatively applying technology in business to drive change, but with a focus on the transformative \npower of artificial intelligence and what it means to leverage AI as a game- \nchanging multiplier for your business. Today’s episode is a case study of sorts. As AI expands its reach to different industries, the healthcare profession is on the forefront of adoption. The integration of AI into the healthcare industry is fostering a more \ninclusive and efficient healthcare system. Pushkin’s very own Dr. Laurie Santos, host of The \nHappiness Lab podcast, sat down for a conversation with Alice Crisci. Alice is the co-founder and \nCEO of fertility care provider Ovum Health. Founded in 2023, Ovum Health consists of a \nmultispecialty group of board-certified experts, physicians, nutritionists and patient \nadvocates who are passionate about helping moms-to-be with prepregnancy, pregnancy and \npostpartum healthcare. As an online platform, they are able to diagnose, treat, and manage \nconditions from the comfort of patients ’homes. Alice became an advocate for accessible \nfamily planning when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 31.\nAs a healthcare activist, author, cancer and infertility survivor, she has \ndedicated her life to improving access to exceptional healthcare regardless of income, \ninsurance, religion, race, identity or location. Alice and Laurie discuss the barriers to healthcare access, \nthe ways in which AI can be leveraged to expand the reach of \nhealthcare providers, and how Ovum Health partnership with IBM and the use of IBM  watsonx Assistant platform has been enhancing the patient experience. Just a heads up before we dive in—this \nconversation touches on sensitive topics such as maternal health and fertility. \nPlease take care when listening. Okay, let’s get to the conversation. Laurie: Alice, thank you so much Laurie: Alice, thank you so much for joining me. To start off, tell me  a little bit about your current role Alice: Hi, Laurie. Thank you so much for having \nme today. I'm thrilled to be here. My current role is as co-founder and CEO of Ovum Health. We \nare a network of fertility telehealth clinics in the United States. And really, my job is to \nmake sure that all the people that we want to serve know that we exist. And to make sure that I \ncreate a sustainable company so that all the good work that my clinicians are doing really reach the \nmillions—truly, millions—of people who need us. Laurie: So your fertility journey began \nat 31 when you were diagnosed with cancer. That must have been awful. Tell me about \nthe days and weeks surrounding that news, and what was your life like? Alice: Yes, the way that I've always described it is that the news almost hit the pause \nbutton on my life. And the extraordinary thing was that it became my full-time job, just managing \nall the diagnostic steps involved. So truly, for the first 30 days, I was in a vortex \nof all things cancer related. And I was one of the lucky ones in that a friend asked \nme, “Are you going to freeze your eggs?” I would never have even thought to \nask about it had she not brought it up. I went into the fertility clinic, \nand really what was extraordinary is that the day before my appointment at the \nphysical clinic, I had a telephone consult. This is before the term “telehealth” or \n“telemedicine” was even a thing, okay? Because it was so many years ago. She called by phone; \nthere was no videoconferencing even invented yet. So it was 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, and it was already \nday two of my cycle, and she said to me, “Alice, if you're going to do this, you have to start \ntomorrow morning at 7 a.m.” So I had less than 24 hours to make the biggest decision of my life. \nAnd at the time I had a boyfriend who was working in the front bedroom of my home. Okay. I walk into \nthat room and say, “Okay, I'm all excited. We have to freeze embryos.” And he looked at me and he \ngoes, “We're not going to do that.” And I said, “What do you mean, ‘We're not going to do that’?”\nHe said, “No, I'm not going to do that with you.” I said, “Why wouldn't you do that with me?” And he \ntold me then that he didn't think we had a future together.  And in that moment, I was on my own. \nSo when I walked into the fertility clinic the next morning, they handed me a catalog of sperm \ndonors. So—can you imagine? Okay, I'm already dealing with cancer, completely overwhelmed, \nand I get handed a catalog of sperm donors, and it was all these statistics, so it looked like \nI was picking a basketball team and being like, “Who do I think is going to be MVP this year?”\nAnd I had a friend with me at the appointment who said “No, I think this is going to be so much \nfun.” And I handed the catalog to her and I was like, “Great. You pick.” So part of the journey\nwas such a massive learning curve so fast. But going through fertility preservation \nhelped me focus on life after cancer. So I always fundamentally, deeply believed \n“I'm going to get through this cancer.” But I also knew I wanted to live the life I \nimagined afterwards. And that whole experience started that journey: What is life going to \nlook like after I get through all this trauma? But for me, I felt the fertility-preservation \nexperience was incredibly life affirming. You know, I loved the self-injections because \nit felt like I finally was doing something for my life rather than having the \nmedical community do something to me. Laurie: And—so talk about how that \nexperience led you to the founding of Fertile Action and MedAnswers.\nAlice: Well, I—I literally walked out of the fertility clinic that same day. The \nbusiness manager had handed me—kind of, like, pushed a piece of paper across her desk to show \nme how expensive the treatment was going to be. It was a $20,000 expense. And I, you know, almost \nflipped out. I thought, “Well, how am I going to do this?” And you could see the look on her \nface. She almost felt devastated that in my time of need, she couldn't just give this to me.\nMy friend Jen was on the phone with the only nonprofit that existed at the time, who basically \nwas telling her I don't qualify. I, meanwhile, was on the phone with my American Express card \ngetting an increase limit. So that moment was the first game changer, because I walked out of the \noffice and I looked at my friend Jen and I said, “We're going to start a nonprofit. We're \ngoing to fix this.” I felt offended that there would be, uh, financial criteria to \ndetermine who gets help and who doesn't. I think—you know, you're, you're 31 \nyears old. You're at the prime of, of your career. You're still climbing the ladder. \nYou haven't made it. I barely had enough years to, you know, put into a 401(k) or an IRA. \nI don't have a nest egg. You know, this was not something that I felt, like, we \nneeded to make people prove that they have financial need. The cancer is the need. And I \nwas offended that insurance didn't cover it. And insurance was willing to cover a wig. They \nwere willing to cover reconstructive breasts. And so it seemed that society was telling me, “It's \nmore important to us that you look like a woman when you're done with us than actually produce \noffspring like a woman.” I was really disturbed by that. So that was—the first pivotal moment \nof starting a charity was because I wanted to educate, I wanted to advocate. Laurie: And so talk about how that passion ultimately evolved into  the launch of Ovum Health in 2023. Alice: Well, what ended up happening is \nI was doing all this advocacy work and all this legislative change, and I was \neducating all up and down California. But I also was witnessing the spread of \nmisinformation on Facebook groups. At the time, I knew a lot of clinicians, and I had them on \ntext, and so these women were asking questions on these groups, and, and I was able to get an answer \nwithin 15 minutes from my professional network, so I thought, “Okay, well, there's \ngot to be a better way to do this.” So with my business partner, uh, the illustrious \nDr. Santiago Munne, who's a world-renowned reproductive geneticist and researcher—I emailed \nhim and I said, “We've got to do something about this.” There's got to be a digital way \nto let everyone have access to the people that he and I know, and they should \nbe able to ask questions in a safe, protected environment by actual experts—not \ntheir peers pretending to be an expert, right? We all have that, that person who's like, \n“Well, I had this experience, and therefore my experience pertains to your experience,” and \nit's just not personalized at all. So I thought, with technology where it's at, there's no reason \nnot to create an app that can connect the public with a trusted network of professionals.\nThat was the first thing that we did, and we ran that for years. So we have over 90,000 pieces \nof clinically validated content. Multidisciplinary specialists who have answered patient questions \nas volunteers, which is extraordinary. But what we saw in the data—because we collected so much \nhealth information on our users—we saw that they weren't being diagnosed with infertility, yet \nthey had been infertile for more than three years. And because they weren't diagnosed \nwith infertility, they also weren't being diagnosed with the underlying conditions \ncausing infertility. So to me, infertility is a frustrating diagnosis because it's based on time. \nIt's not based on labs. It's not based on imaging. It's not based on anything except “You don't have \nthe outcome that you want in the time frame that the professional societies has deemed relevant.”\nIf you're under the age of 35 and haven't gotten pregnant the old-fashioned way in a year, you have \na disease diagnosis of infertility. The medical community wasn't telling women that in the same \nway that I had someone call me and say, “I'm sorry to break the bad news: you have breast cancer.” \nIf we don't know that somebody has infertility, then they're not looking at the underlying cause.\nSo you have women who are trying to figure out what's going on, and they're, they're turning \nto Facebook groups or they're turning to other online communities. They're—and trying to take, \nyou know, this supplement, that supplement, but they're, they're not really going \nthrough a proper diagnostic journey. And we wanted to solve that. So ob-gyns—even \nthough we think of them as the ones that deliver the babies, they're actually not trained in \nfertility. They're not trained in diagnostics for infertility, and they're not trained \nin, in optimizing fertility. And then you have the IVF doctors that are \nthe most extreme treatment possible. That has helped millions of babies be born \nworldwide and is a wonderful treatment, but it doesn't need to be the first line \nof treatment. There are so many conditions that can actually be treated to help restore \nnatural fecundity, meaning someone's ability to ovulate on their own at the right time of \nthe month to ensure that the size of the egg is optimal, to ensure that the timing of the \negg release is optimal, and to ensure that sperm has the best possible chance of getting \nto the egg for a fertilization event to happen. When you look at all the optimization steps that \nare possible, it's a miracle that anybody gets pregnant on their own, okay? It really is. And I \nthink we're all raised with the idea that when we, we want to have a baby, we think it's \ngoing to be easy and it's going to be fine, because we've spent all of our lives telling \nyoung people how not to get pregnant. That—we make it seem like they're going to look \nat a man and get pregnant. And that's just not, not what's so. We can help same-sex couples \noptimize their attempt as well. And, you know, that is both on the male side and on the female \nside. So really, Ovum Health was created to solve a huge gap that exists, and it's not just in the \nUnited States; it's worldwide. Between an ob-gyn and an IVF doctor, so that—we can get all those \ndiagnostics done. And then we can do medical nutrition therapy first to start optimizing \neach step of the fertility process, and then use pharmaceutical solutions to kind of take over \nthe cycle—ovulatory experience—to make sure that we are helping to craft the, the most effective \nand efficient timed intercourse cycle possible. Laurie: So your situation was just \nso awful, right? Where you had to pay for your treatment on an Amex card.\nI'm curious what the current state of access is for family-building treatments in the \nU.S. Is there still this higher socioeconomic barrier for fertility treatment \ncompared to other health issues? Alice: There definitely is. And it varies \nwidely. So with Ovum Health, we are practicing medicine in a lane that's covered by insurance.\nWe're not doing anything that falls outside of your normal kind of consultative approach to \naccessing specialty care. Because of this, we're covered by insurance. There are some \ninnovative testing platforms that are not covered by insurance. So we work with our patients to \nhelp them with all their out-of-pocket expenses. We do offer financing in house. \nWe offer payment plans. You know, we try to be as flexible as possible to make \nsure that there is no socioeconomic barrier. I have 176 insurance contracts as of today, in \n8 states. I intend to be in all 50 states by the end of next year with insurance contracts. \nMy hunch is we’ll have over 600 contracts. That includes Medicaid. So there are plenty \nof things that Medicaid pays for. And it's not just our ability to help someone have a \nhealthy pregnancy; it's our ability to help someone have a healthy baby. And that means that \nwe have to support women through the reproductive continuum. So what Ovum is really creating is \nbeing the glue at, kind of, every step of that experience for a woman.\nIn the IVF setting, yes, there are still huge gaps in coverage. There \nare a lot of programs out there like Carrot and Progyny that have targeted the large-employer \nmarket as a specialty insurance product. Only 0.3 percent of reproductive-age people work \nfor large employers. So it's really important that we still access IVF coverage through your \nbasic health insurance plans, like the Aetnas and the Blues and the UnitedHealthcares.\nThat's where you still have coverage gaps, and so much of that is dependent on \nwho your employer coverage is through, and so much of that is if you're self-insured \nor if you're on Medicaid, etc. So Medicaid currently doesn't cover infertility services, \nand Medicaid pays for about half of the pregnancies and live births in America.\nSo we have to start thinking more broadly about treatment options. Laurie: And so—walk us through a typical patient journey with Ovum Health, from first contact to final outcome. What are all the ways that Ovum helps them build a family? Alice: Yes, that’s a great question. So really, the first thing that we’re looking  at is a diagnostic journey that we want to get people through rapidly.\nSo in a traditional healthcare environment, if you have to see the number of specialists \nthat are under one roof at Ovum, it probably would take you six months to see all of them. And \nyou’d have six to twelve different appointments, because that’s how many specialists we’re bringing \nonto your case. So you initially meet with our nurse practitioner to review your medical history.\nWe do ask you to fill out quite a bit of data, because we want it to be, again, as efficient \nas possible for you. We don’t want to waste your time. We want to make sure that we are well\nprepared to be able to ask all the follow-up questions and review that medical \nhistory so that we can turn around and order your lab work right away.\nSo typically when someone calls in to us, we actually book four appointments for them at \nonce so that they don’t have any delays. We book that first visit. We book the lab appointment \nfor them at their local lab. After the lab visit, then our patients get to meet with the lead \nclinician on their case. And that’s usually when they get an initial diagnosis from the \nlab work and the history that we reviewed. At that point, then, we probably need to send \nthem for imaging. We need to do fallopian tube evaluation, uterine evaluation, and ovarian \nevaluation. And they then get paired with a nurse navigator. That nurse navigator’s job is to help \nthem understand what their treatment options are going to be. The doctor had already reviewed \nthe treatment options. However, as we all know, we are trying to take in as much information \nas we can in that doctor visit, and then as soon as we get in the car, or as soon as we get \noff the phone, we think of 30 questions to ask. So we pair them with a nurse navigator so that \nthey have somebody to ask all those follow-up questions efficiently. At that point, then, we lay \nout kind of what the next three to four months of their life is going to look like. In all cases, we \nassign them a registered dietitian. So they have a nurse navigator that is the glue of their \ncase and helping to facilitate every next step. They’re assigned a registered dietitian and \nthey even get a patient advocate, who’s kind of advocating for their insurance, helping them \nunderstand what else they need, where they need to order it. It could be a custom supplement \nlist. It could be an at-home continuous hormone monitoring kit. It could be their molecular \nsperm-testing kit for their partner as well. So we line up kind of the diagnostic journey \nfirst, but in a lot of cases we’re already starting some medical nutrition therapy, or \nmedicated weight loss, or working with the registered dietitian even alongside some of the \nother steps, because we have some of the diagnoses already. We know people who are insulin resistant. \nSo we know what kind of diet plan we need to help them with. We know the lifestyle changes we \nneed to pair them with. We’re even adding PT into our practice, so that we can customize \nexercise plans specific to somebody’s condition. Laurie: Ovum Health is also launching during \nthis pivotal moment in AI. And so I’m curious: was it always the plan to leverage this \ntechnology for Ovum? Or was it more of an organic evolution to this point? Alice: It was both. It was always my intention that we needed to have AI-enabled  technology to be able to scale faster and to also be able to improve quality control across so \nmany states, because how do you really do that? I need to upskill all different levels \nof healthcare providers. Then how do we efficiently kind of manage that clinical \nexcellence experience? And the only way to really do that is to create clinical \ndecision–support tools that everybody utilizes that are very easy, to make sure that \nwe’re managing our care in a consistent fashion. How else could we possibly do it? State by \nstate, you know, experience level varies. So that was always kind of the plan. The area that \nI didn’t even know was possible was this area of being able to reach the masses truly through \nan AI tool, through the Fertility Answers app. So when IBM approached me for \nthat partnership, the bells went off. I always knew that I couldn’t scale volunteer \nhumans. I have a network of over 400 medical professionals across so many disciplines. We’re \ntalking MDs, genetic counselors, geneticists, psychologists, ob-gyns, naturopaths, functional \nmedicine docs. I have about 13 different specialties, all willing to answer free questions, but relying on that voluntary basis \nis, is not something that can scale. It’s a beautiful thing that they’re doing, and \nit’s created 90,000 pieces of clinically validated content, but we needed to move beyond kind of \nthe initial interaction, being a human answering the question, and leverage AI to be able to do \nthat. So what was really extraordinary for me is that I had my eyes kind of opened by IBM to \nsee what was possible for my practice with AI. Once that seed was planted, then the world \nopened up. We have four tools that we’re working on right now. The first has already been \nintegrated, which is the Fertility Answers app. So the initial experience for Fertility Answers: \nwomen—and mostly women, because they’re the ones downloading the app, but we take men. I promise \nwe’re not excluding them! We see both. It takes two. And they have the opportunity to access all \nthat content in a personalized way through the IBM Watson Assistant chatbot. So that is incredible.\nWe’re also deploying a revenue-cycle management tool. You can imagine: with all these \ndifferent contracts that I have—176 contracts, and eventually I’ll have probably 600 contracts—\nthey all have different price lists. Makes it very difficult to forecast what’s in my \nelectronic medical record system for that day, based on the type of insurance. Now, even within \none insurance contract, they might have hundreds of insurance plans that have all various \nmechanisms for what we can expect to bill. You might have coinsurance, you might have \na deductible, you might have a copay, and it varies plan to plan. We’re dealing with a level of \nmedical literacy in this country that is very low. And the layperson doesn’t understand \ntheir insurance all the time. How am I expected to be able to deal with truly \nthousands of combinations of insurance plans based on these contracts? You have to \nhave AI just to tackle that big-data issue. So we have a revenue-cycle management \ntool that is also helping us with an automated clinical workflow. And that’s—what a \nwonderful partner we have, called CloudAstra, who is also in the IBM ecosystem. So it’s \nincredibly exciting to know that I can come out of a startup mode profitably because \nwe’re deploying smart tools from the beginning. Then we also have in development our fertility \nclinical decision–support tool to really scale the clinical experience so that we’re analyzing \ngenomic data, lab data, clinical data, and even self- reported data from our users in a way \nthat helps our clinicians know what to do next. And that’s all based on standard-of-care \nguidelines, all evidence-based medicine, but built into a really useful tool to help \nthem do their job more efficiently. Recently, the international guidelines for PCOS—polycystic \novarian syndrome—updated guidelines. There were 200 individual points in these guidelines. \nTwo hundred! And that’s for one condition. So imagine you multiply that across dozens of \nconditions. You can’t expect a human to retain that information and to be able to recall it, \nyou know, right when someone’s in front of them. So tools that have IBM’s AI enabled are really \ncritical to do an exceptional job in healthcare. And then the fourth tool that we’re creating \nwith IBM is a medical nutrition therapy tool so that we can scale beyond our registered \ndietitians and be able to help women really optimize their fertility, health, and wellness \nby having a personalized approach to medical nutrition therapy. And that also requires AI. Laurie: So when you decided to go big and introduce AI in so many different ways to scale up your app and, and your business more broadly, why did you pick IBM as a partner? Alice: IBM was an easy yes when we were approached about this partnership, for so many reasons. I'm not an AI startup; I'm a healthcare startup, and it's very important that I don't waste resources \ntrying to figure out AI all by ourselves. We needed to be very fast to market and needed \nto be with a trusted partner. IBM brought that to the team right away. But secondarily, the IBM \nteam that I've been exposed to is incredible. So from a partnership standpoint, the team has made \nit easy. Joyful. Uh, they're some of the smartest people that I, I've had the pleasure to work with.\nAnd so I think the culture of what IBM's created for startups is very unique. And truly, every \nsingle aspect of the team that I've worked with, from the developers themselves that build labs to \nthe customer-success team to my day-to-day team—I mean, my goodness, it is just a dream team. So \nIBM made it as easy as possible for me to say yes. Malcolm Gladwell: Alice really helped open my eyes to \nthe challenges facing providers. In an industry as sensitive and individualized as fertility care, \nit makes sense that scalability would be an issue. But with the help of AI, Ovum Health has been able to solve a few of the extraordinary challenges \nof bringing effective, affordable fertility care to the general public—from multiplying the \nimpact of its medical-professional network to enabling more-accurate forecasting of complex \ncontracts. Patients are benefiting directly and indirectly from the integration \nof AI across the healthcare journey. Laurie: A lot of people have nuanced health questions that are unique to them due to their own personal health history, maybe their lifestyle factors, or specific medication they're taking, how does the fertility bot personalize all its responses Alice:Yeah, that's a great question. So when we onboard our users, we do ask them to fill out quite ab it of health information, and we have 99% compliance rates on the health information people fill out. So when you ask a question, you're asking it with all your health information already attached to it. The library of responses then shows \nyou questions and answers of people who are similar to you. If that \ndoesn't answer your question, you still have a chance to route your question to \nthe same volunteer network of professionals that existed before the bot was there. Laurie: And so some problems, especially those related to fertility and \nnatal care, require human-to-human connection, right? This is what we're built for as primates, \nto kind of engage with our families. As the chatbot addresses such a personal health need, \nhow easy is it for a doctor to interject or for a patient to request care from a doctor? Alice: Very easy, and that was super important to me. One of the things that I love the most  out of IBM was that I had the chance to infuse empathy directly into the bot experience.\nI didn't want something that sounded or came off as robotic. But it is incredibly easy in \nthe Watson Assistant flow for someone to request that immediate human connection. We have a chat \nfeature that gets to a patient advocate right away. We have a feature where they can route their \nquestion to that network of experts right away. And we have a feature where they \ncan book a consult with one of our medical professionals right away as well. Laurie: So you have over 67,000 users now, which is kind of amazing. How do you \nget them to feel the kind of trust and empathy people expect from their healthcare \nprovider, especially in the fertility space? Alice: In our case, we have a very human brand. \nSo from the moment that someone interacts with our content, they're already experiencing \nclinically validated answers in the form of video. We don't ask people to download and register our \napp upon the first touch point. You know, we are infusing medical education into the community \nthrough video so that they can start to build that brand trust with us from the beginning. What I've \nnoticed is that because our brand is such a human connection, we've built up so much trust.\nAnd it's not just about the app experience; it's also how active our Instagram is. It’s where \nwe answer live questions for people—in Instagram Live. So there's multiple ways for people to \nget served for virtually free and in unlimited fashion. We've vetted all the providers \nfor them so they don't have to do that. So I think that there's multiple things that go \ninto building brand trust. That's why we show sort of the profile of someone who asked a similar \nquestion already so that they can find themselves in that; “Oh, wow, that person who asked my \nsimilar question or almost my exact same question also is 37 years old, or also has PCOS, or also \nhas endo.” So there are different ways that we are able to kind of get into the psychology of \nour community to make sure that they feel heard. And I think whenever anybody feels truly \nheard, then that trust is, is possible. Laurie: So this season of Smart Talks features New \nCreators—visionaries like you who are creatively applying technology in business to drive change. I \nknow that you have a bachelor of science in media arts and design. How does this creative background \ninform what you do as CEO of Ovum Health? Alice: Oh, that's such a great question. I use \nmy degree every single day. And I am—I'm not a spring chicken. So I've had that degree for \nquite a while, Laurie. Every CEO has kind of a, I would say, leading skill set. You know, there \nare some that are leading financial-type people. There's some that are leading, kind \nof, business-to-business salespeople. I'm very much a leading marketing-type \nCEO. So for me, the patient experience, the user experience, that human experience is \nkind of everything that I stand for and I'm about, and it must be authentic. And because of the \nbackground that I have, I love nothing more than coproducing with my chief storyteller, \nJoshua Noonan, who's been with me forever. We love coproducing content. It could be a \n22-second video that, that's educational. It could be an hour-long course, you know, for \nprofessionals. And so I do feel that I bring that media arts and design background to, kind \nof, my type of leadership. And storytelling is kind of everything. You know, being a great \nstoryteller, no matter what your brand is, or no matter the type of leader you are, is the way \nthat kind of attracts and connects people to us. And it's, you know, fortunate that social media \nhas created this visual world that we live in and this video-based world that we live in as well. Laurie: So you're an activist for accessibility and inclusivity in healthcare. If you could  look years down the line, how do you see creative applications of technology like Fertility \nAnswers changing how we talk about women's health? Alice: Well, first I think that these tools need \nto be covered by insurance. So I think what is going to be the game changer in the value-based \ncare market is that insurance is going to figure out that by creating a reimbursement mechanism for \nmore digital therapeutics, but also for digital diagnostic tools, it’s going to lead to a much \nmore cost-effective healthcare society, no matter what kind of insurance type or plan that we have.\nSo on the accessibility side, those tools are really meaningful to the future of healthcare. \nI would also say that technology creates a more democratized healthcare environment. A lot of \nour patients live four hours from a type of specialist that they need. Four hours! You \nknow, a lot of them are at least an hour, an hour and a half from a major lab.\nSo leveraging these types of tools gets them the answers that they need faster, \nwhich will lead to better intervention earlier. And that's where we come down to “Healthy \nmamas, healthy babies make happy families.” Laurie: Awesome. That's a great way to end. Thank \nyou, Alice, so much for being with us on Smart Talks today. It is such great work that you are \ndoing to help women and families. So thank you for all your work and thanks for our chat today. Alice: Thank you, Laurie. It's such an honor to get to be on Smart Talks and it was a delightful conversation. Malcolm Gladwell: That about wraps up today’s episode. \nI want to send a huge thank-you to Laurie and Alice for deepening the way I think about AI’s \nexpanding role in the future of healthcare. It was illuminating to hear a firsthand account \nof how providers are already integrating the power of transparent, human-centric generative \nAI through watsonx. It's enabling telehealth platforms to multiply their impact \nand is quickly becoming essential to offering comprehensive care to patients.\nAs our conversation with Laurie and Alice showed, accessibility has long been an issue facing \npatients, particularly in the fertility space. With the help of technology from IBM, Ovum \nHealth is meaningfully expanding its reach to women who previously may not have been \nable to access personalized fertility care. Steps like these are helping to usher \nin a new age in healthcare—one that holds incredible potential for both patients and \nproviders. Yet as new technology is implemented, it needs to be done with responsibility and care.\nUsing emerging technologies in sensitive fields like fertility has the power to \ntransform how people receive care—but, as Alice emphasized, only if patient needs \nare central to how we implement solutions. Ovum Health already has over 67,000 users—just \nthink of all the pregnancies that have been supported by the platform. And, as we just \nheard, this is only the beginning. It's exciting to see how this new technology \nwill continue to reach people in need. Smart Talks with IBM is produced \nby Matt Romano, Joey Fischground, and Jacob Goldstein.
