This season, we're diving back into\nthe world of artificial intelligence, but with a focus on the powerful\nconcept of open, its possibilities, implications, and misconceptions. We'll look at openness from a variety\nof angles and explore how the concept is already reshaping industries,\nways of doing business, and our very notion of what's possible. I'm particularly excited for\ntoday's guest, Brian Ryerson. He is senior Director of Digital Strategy\nat the US Tennis Association, helping to oversee one of the most iconic events\nin the world of sports, the US Open. Brian sat down with Pushkin's\nown Jacob Goldstein, host of the podcast, What's Your Problem? A veteran business journalist, Jacob has\nreported for the Wall Street Journal, the Miami Herald, and was a longtime\nhost of the NPR program, Planet Money. IBM has been the official\ntechnology partner of the US Tennis Association for more than 30 years. And the more recent evolution into\ngenerative AI has enhanced the world-class digital experiences that help more than\n15 million fans from all over the world enjoy the US Open Tennis Championships. In this episode, we will explore how\ngenerative AI is being used to generate match insights, spoken commentary\nfor match highlights, and post match summaries at scale for fans to enjoy\nthrough the US Open app and website. We'll explore how these AI solutions\nenable the editorial team to cover more of the tournament than ever before, bringing\nfans even closer to the game they love. And we'll learn more about one of\nthe engines behind this AI-powered content creation: a large language\nmodel from the IBM Granite Family, which is trained and maintained using\nthe watsonx AI and data platform. Okay, let's dive in. Jacob: Brian, welcome to the show. Brian: Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here. Jacob: Can you say your name and your job? Brian: Yeah. I'm Brian Ryerson, I'm Senior Director\nof Digital Strategy at the USTA. Jacob: Dumb question, what's the USTA? Brian: The US Tennis Association. Jacob: And tell me about\nthe USTA, what is it? Brian: Yeah, so the USTA is the\ngoverning body of tennis in the US. Our mission is to grow the sport of\ntennis across the US at all levels. Really, I would say we're more of like a\nhealth and wellness company where tennis is the means to health and wellness. And then the US Open is kind of\nour tent pole event that happens every year in Flushing Meadows, and\nis really our chance to showcase the sport of tennis at its highest\nlevel to fans all around the world. Jacob: Yeah, I mean the US Open, I\nassume most people know this, but it's a Grand Slam, it's one of the, what, four\nbiggest tennis tournaments in the world? Brian: Correct? Yes. Yeah, every year, especially the\npast couple years, we've seen immense growth, and we are very hopeful this\nyear, and our big goal is to have over a million fans on site during\nthe three-week window this year. So it's an amazing event. I always say it's a food and wine festival\nwhere tennis is the main attraction, and it's a really fun, unique atmosphere. Jacob: How did you get\ninto the tennis business? Brian: It's a great question. It's not where I thought I'd end up for,\nespecially being there for 14 years. So I was a marketing and technology major\nin school, and I also played college lacrosse, and sports was always a big\npart of my life, and always wanted to be in the sports and entertainment world. I'm here from the New York\narea, this is where I grew up. So I moved back home, and had\na few friends who worked there. And I started out more on the numbers\nside of things, and really digital analytics, was really the start of when\nFacebook and Twitter was just starting, and digital marketing and all of that. And I went to my first US Open\nnot really knowing what to expect. And again, I think the atmosphere\nkind of captivated me and hooked me in, and I've been there now 14 years. Jacob: And so your title\nis digital director. What does that mean? What's your job? Brian: Yeah, so it's an interesting\none, because it's tough to explain to folks who are not in the weeds on all\nthings US Open or even in the sports world, but really I oversee all of\nour consumer facing digital property. So that's the usopen.org, our website\nbuilt by IBM, as well as our mobile app. I oversee our content strategy,\nour sponsorship integrations. Really anything consumer facing that\nhappens on the web is under my purview. Even some of our new platform extensions\nand gaming and things like that, anything that you can physically interact\nwith is kind of under my purview. Jacob: And so you've been there\nnow for 14-ish years, which in the digital world is a long time. How has that sort of digital experience\nof sports changed over that time? Brian: Yeah, it's obviously grown. Digital now is, what we say and what\nmy team says is, it's the number one way to engage with fans that\ncan't make it to the event, as well as those fans who are at the event,\nand how do you enrich their stay. So it's really kind of, you're\ntackling multiple fan personas. It's the international fan who's staying\nup late to watch in other countries, to the fan here who's maybe watching on\nbroadcast and we go in to accompany and enrich that broadcast with new stats\nand insights, to the onsite fan who bought a ticket and maybe doesn't know\nwhat match is happening on what court. We do have 20 plus courts happening at\na time with all different matches, so really try to help all fans navigate\nthe US Open the best way possible. Jacob: And so what are some of the sort\nof problems you're trying to solve? What are some of the hard\nthings about your job? Brian: Obviously technology\nchanges at a rapid pace, right? So I think part of it is, how do we\nstay on the forefront of that, and how do we do that in the best way and make\nthe best fan experience possible, and the best user experiences possible? That's always kind of\ndriving factor number one. Then number two, it's understanding\nand listening to our fans and what kind of content they want. You'll hear me talk a\nlot about storytelling. I feel like there's a lot of storytelling\nthat happens around the US Open that really, really want to bring to fans. And that can be as simple as storytelling\nof what's happening today and what you should be watching to, maybe it's your\nfavorite players and what's going on behind the scenes with them to, even\nintroducing, I want to say the casual fans to who they should be watching, why\nthey should follow certain players, and more bringing that player's story to life. Jacob: Yeah, I mean I feel like almost\nthe whole point of sports is to create stories for us to follow, right? They're engineered to be stories. Brian: Exactly. Jacob: This thing is happening in front\nof you, and there are two antagonist, and the stakes are high, and you\ndon't know how it's going to end. It's built to be a story. Brian: And that's the main challenge of\nthe job is you can plan, plan, plan, but once you get two players on court and you\ndon't know what that outcome's going to be, it's now sitting, and waiting, and\nwatching, and you become a fan yourself, and then it's, how do you really captivate\nthat story, and how do you narrate it, and how do you translate that to fans? Jacob: And it's like you kind of\nhave to do it in real time, right? The whole point of sports is you\ndon't know what's going to happen. Brian: Exactly, and that's the excitement. And it's also, there's so\nmany different types of fans. There's the fans who want a lot of\nenriched data, and their tennis nerds, for lack of better of saying it, and\nthat they really want to dive deep into the intricacies of the game, versus the\ncasual fan who maybe just wants more of this high level storyline of what\ndoes this mean, why is it important? So it's really trying to figure out how\nto deliver that at scale, and really help fans get what they're looking for, and\nthe type of content they're looking for. Jacob: So are there specific examples\nof how fan feedback has led to specific features, digital features you build? Are there particularly popular\nfeatures you've come up with? What are some specifics? Brian: Yeah, some low-hanging fruit type\nthings that came from fan feedback is simple things sometimes, like managing\ntime zones of when matches start. Jacob: A persistent problem for those\nof us who work across time zones, right? Brian: Exactly. And we do have, like I mentioned,\n20+ courts happening at a time, so it's a lot to follow, and how do\nyou translate that to a fan, whether it's to their native language or to\ntheir time zone or things like that. So that's one thing that\ncame through fan feedback. And another one, a three to five hour\nmatch, especially when you're having 20+ of them happening at a time is, there's\ntoo much for one person to follow. So how do you start from an editorial\nperspective really helping with that storytelling and guiding a fan to like,\nall right, whether there's an upset about to happen, or here's your matches to\nwatch, or even some of the predictions we're starting to put in is, we really\nwant to guide the fan before a match, here's where you should tune in, to\neven after a match of here's what's happened, here's what's important. And we're really excited with some of\nthe features we've built in the last few years that, I would say really helps us\ndo that at more scale than what we were able to do with just writers following\na match and covering every single match. Jacob: So I want to talk a\nlittle bit about the partnership between IBM and the USTA. Just tell me about the\nwork you do together. Brian: So IBM is our official\ndigital and technology partner, and innovation partner of the US Open. They predate me, it's a\n30-year partnership, and it truly is a partnership. So I view the IBM consulting team\nas an extension of my USTA team. So we work with them year\nround, they design, develop, and deliver the digital properties. They help us provide the tools to\ncreate content, to do things at scale. They help us from stats and\ninformation, and really help us push from an innovation standpoint\nto make sure that we are staying on that cutting edge of technology. So I would truly say it is much\nmore than a sponsorship, where it's truly a partnership to\ndeliver that fan experience. Jacob: And so what are some\nof the specific things that you have done with IBM? Brian: Yeah, so I mean there's\ncountless ones to talk through. Obviously 30 years ago they helped\nus build our first website, and it's kind of grown from there. Over the past few years, I\nwould say, I think it was 2018 is we started AI highlights. So that was really when we were able\nto have all 20 matches going at a single time, we were able to quickly\ndeliver succinct highlights to fans to our digital platform, so they could\nsee highlights for every single court. Jacob: Is that video highlights? Is that text summaries? What does that mean? Brian: At the time it\nwas video highlights. So it was really taking that three to\nfive hour match, let's say, and cut it down to a three-minute highlight that\ncould show up within moments after a match ending to our website and our mobile app. So fans could see that all around the\nworld and really kind of get that three minute overview, what happened in a match. Jacob: And was that AI enabled? Was AI a piece of how to do that? Brian: It was, it was probably\nour first foray into AI back then. Jacob: Well 2018 is relatively early. Brian: Yeah, exactly. Jacob: Early for tennis. Brian: Exactly, yeah. It really, I don't want to say\nopened up our ability to one, again, story tell, but attract new fans\ntoo is, video has actually been our number one growth area since 2018- Jacob: Makes sense. ... Brian: and I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the scale of how we deliver that content. Jacob: Using AI and being able\nto deliver the sort of video highlight reels at scale. Brian: Yeah, and do it quickly, right? We've always had highlights, but\nit was a manual process where you had a video editor cutting through\na three-hour match, selecting the right scene, stitching together, it\nwould've to get voiced over, et cetera. We really have used AI to make it,\nI want to say, much more efficient and speed up that process, and\ndeliver it more quickly to our fans. Jacob: I mean, it would be a bummer\nto get scooped by whatever, NBC News or ESPN or whatever, I'm sure they're\nall your partners and you love them. Brian: Yeah, exactly. Jacob: Obviously you want to\nhave the video first, right? It's your match. Brian: Yeah, and I think it's also\nimportant to us as being the USTA is ensuring that it's not just the\nmain marquee player, it's that every player in all those storylines, and\nthat whether it's the main singles draw to or mixed doubles, et cetera,\nthey all need highlights, and they all have their own stories to tell,\nand how do we do that at scale? It was something that before\nwe had that product, it was not something we were able to do. Jacob: Great. So let's talk in some more detail\nabout what you're working on. Let's start with the app. Tell me about the US Open app\nand the companion website. Brian: Yeah, so I'll start with the\napp, and I feel like they serve similar needs, but they're a little different\nin their own respective manners. The app, everybody has a phone\nin their hands at this point. The app is kind of their guide to,\nwhen I say a million fans on site, we view the app as, we want that to\nbe their onsite guide and companion. Jacob: A million, let's just pause\non a million fans on site, right? Because like a big, professional,\nwhatever, an NFL game or something, that's like 100,000, this is 10X that. Brian: Yeah, in a three-week\nwindow, in a very succinct, tight, action-packed window. There's a lot of action coming through. Jacob: A lot of logistics. Okay, so keep going. Brian: Yes. So the app, whether it's finding\nthe schedules, the live scores, what's happening on court, that's\nreally the focus point of the app. And what we're really focused on this\nyear is, how do we build in some of those match summaries into the app,\ninto our SlamTracker experience? So again, before a match, that kind\nof match preview of here's maybe... If you have a ticket, here's what to\nexpect, here's our likelihood to win, who we are predicting, so you can kind\nof get some information heading in. And then after the match it's more\nof, what just happened, what it means for the rest of the draw, who they're\nplaying next, is this the first time this has happened, et cetera, and really\nenriching that experience as well. So the app is one, your guide to\nwhat you should be watching, but also then giving you that insights\nand context of what's happening on that court as you're watching it. Jacob: It's like the\ncommentator in your pocket. Brian: Exactly. Jacob: So you used a phrase in\nthere, as if I already knew it, and I love the phrase, but I\nwant you to talk more about it. That phrase is SlamTracker. Brian: Yes. So SlamTracker is our longstanding live\nscores, I want to say match center. It is where every single data point for\nevery single match lives, and it really helps showcase what's happening to match. I say it's our broadcast companion. So if you're watching live,\nit's our in-stadium companion. It's also the best thing to have\nif you aren't able to watch. Jacob: And so like I'm on the app and\nthere's a thing called SlamTracker? Brian: Yes. Jacob: And I tap SlamTracker, what do I\nsee on my phone when I tap SlamTracker midday when the tournament's happening? Brian: So before a match, that's where\nyou get a lot of pre-match content, that's where those live, kind of our predictions,\nour likelihood to win lives within that. So likelihood to win essentially pulls in\na bunch of data points, so pass matches how many times the players have played\nagainst each other, even some punditry and other written articles that maybe\nour editorial team put out, and really kind of puts a prediction out there. Jacob: And so it's just\na percentage chance? Brian: Yes, exactly. But it uses millions of data\npoints that come up with that Jacob: Yes. ... Brian: so it really helps you understand\nwhat you're getting into for that match. During a live match, it is every single\npoint, so point-by-point scoring, as well as in-depth analysis and point commentary. Or also this year I have a live\nvisualization that accompanies that, that will really help bring the match together. And what I mean by that is it uses\nour ball-tracking technology to really showcase the match in near real time. So within seconds delay of where the\nball's being hit, where the players are, and really bring a visualization to life,\nand layered stats and data on top of that. Jacob: Is that sort of like, when I'm\nwatching a match on TV and there's a close call, is the ball in or out,\nand they do that thing where they kind of show a sort of video game\nversion of where the ball landed. Does it look like that? Brian: It's like that,\nbut for every single shot. So it's not just those close ones. It's our first foray to\nbring that match to life. Jacob: And so what do I see on\nthat kind of view that I don't see from whatever, watching the video? Brian: Yeah, so one, you'll be able\njust to see more of the ball trajectory and where the ball's being hit, but\nthen you can also start layering things in stats and insights on top of that. So how many times has Player A hit\nthe ball on a certain baseline? How fast are they hitting it? Maybe their served percentage at a\ncertain side of the court, et cetera. So you can really start layering\nin for the ones that really want to dive deep into the- Jacob: It's for the nerds, it's for the... It's the information rich. Brian: Exactly. It's the strategy of tennis. It really should be an interesting\nway to slice and dice a match. Jacob: Huh. Malcolm: It's remarkable how the\nUSTA is leveraging AI to enhance fan engagement and deliver immersive\nexperiences both onsite and online. Brian's emphasis on storytelling\nreally underscores the evolution of sports marketing. The SlamTracker feature\nparticularly caught my attention. It's essentially bringing the\nexcitement of a tennis match to life in your palm moment by moment. As someone who appreciates the\nnarrative intricacies of sports, I find it compelling how AI helps predict\nand analyze matches in real time. Jacob: Tell me about the\nAI commentary feature. Brian: Yeah, I know I mentioned\nAI highlights back in 2018. It's now progressed for us and again,\nif we go back to before we had AI highlights, to have a highlight ready\nfor the site it was a video editor cutting the highlight, it getting voiced\nover, and then being published to the site, and it took probably an hour+ for\nthat highlight to really be created. Now with AI commentary, not only are\nwe creating and cutting the highlights using our AI technology, but it's now\nusing all the data points that we have around the match, whether it's our live\nscoring data, our ball trajectory data, et cetera, and it's really creating a script\nto help story-tell around that match, and that's all using watsonx technology. And then using text to speech, we're\nable to actually then create the commentary on top of that, which\nall happens now within minutes. So our team's able to now create\nfully voiced highlights for every men's and women's singles\nmatch to our site within minutes. Jacob: So I know there's a new\nfeature you're working on for this year called Match Reports. Brian: Yes. Jacob: What are Match Reports? Brian: It's our ability to\nsuccinctly tell the story of a match. So everything that happens in five\nhours within that match, down to a couple paragraphs that really\nhelps a user understand or a fan understand what just happened. Again, some key stats, what's upcoming,\nreally help us with that storytelling. In the past, when we have 22 courts\nhappening at a certain time, we would have to pick and choose which stories\nwe think, or which matches we think are going to have the best stories,\nand that's a really hard thing to predict from an editorial perspective. With our match reports now, we'll be\nable to have full coverage of every single match during the main draw. Jacob: So of course I want\nto talk about generative AI. How could we not talk about generative AI? Brian: Of course. Jacob: What are you working\non with generative AI? Brian: So Match Reports is\nthe prime example of it. So Match reports would be completely\nusing watsonx generative AI technology. And really, again, to us it's, how\ncan we do that storytelling at scale? Tennis is such a data rich sport. All sports have data, but tennis has\na lot of shots, and different shot types, and ball trajectory, and live\nscoring data, and umpire chair data, and crowd, and all of that factoring in. Generative AI really helps us take some\nof that structured and unstructured data, really one, organize it in a\nway, but then help us quickly tell that story at scale to all of our fans. And I think we're really just starting\nto scratch at some of the capabilities, and we're really excited about where\nwe're being, but we also see the opportunity of even how we can grow\nto new fans, and new fans around the world using generative AI in the future. Jacob: I'm curious, and you alluded\nto this a moment ago, but I'd like to talk a little bit more about it. It seems interesting as a technical\nproblem is, the nature of turning tennis matches into stories, which is\nfundamentally what we're talking about here in different ways and different\nmedia, is about taking both structured data, like the stats points, stats\nmatches, and also unstructured data like commentary, and articles, and the\nkind of fuzzier parts of storytelling. And so I'm curious how AI kind\nof helps you manage both the structured and the unstructured data. Brian: So I think the structured data\nis pretty self-explanatory, but when you get into the unstructured data and\nsome of the punditry, that's where you get more of the opinion pieces into it. Like a specific player matchup,\nthis player always plays well against so-and-so, or they always\nplay well at night, or they're a fan favorite and the crowd... Adrenaline and the crowd being\nbehind you can really motivate you to play a lot better. So it pulls in all those unstructured\npieces and helps us really put some more rigor around it, and help add\nand enrich our storytelling with it. Jacob: And so I'm curious, when\nyou're starting to use generative AI over the past few years, what\nwere your concerns going into that? Brian: I think our biggest concern\nis ensuring that one, factually it is correct, because it's only as good\nas the data you feed in, and how do you really ensure that your model's\nworking right, and that the output and the data you're feeding it matches the\noutput, and how do you do that at scale? So we do have a lot of human intervention. That's where the IBM consulting team,\nthey're on site with us for those full three weeks really helping us review\neverything and we're constantly learning, especially early in the tournament. And I would say the other big\nconcern, again it goes around to the data is, what data do we have\navailable that is trustworthy? So we are feel very confident with\nthe data that comes off of court, but when we get into that unstructured\npiece, what are the right data sources? How do we validate those data sources,\nand how do we ensure that they're accurate, because the data that has to\ngo in has to be accurate for the output. Jacob: So how do you do that? That's the concern. How do you address it? Brian: Yeah, so I think there's\na number of tools that we use, all within the watsonx umbrella. We do a lot of training with the\nIBM team, so we have to constantly train and retrain that model. I think the other piece that we're\ndoing is, again, as we're creating that content and we have the IBM consulting\nteam on site helping us with that, is as we see things and we see outputs,\nit's re-feeding that back into the model to make it better for the next time. So it's a constantly learning\nprocess that we're undergoing. Jacob: So I want to talk about scale. Brian: Yes. Jacob: You have what, 22 different courts\nwith matches going all at the same time. You're trying to approximately instantly\ngenerate summaries of all these matches in something like real time. And I'm curious, in particular how\nthe IBM models you're using, the IBM granite models are helping you scale? Brian: Yeah, so I think one of the\nbig learnings we had with IBM granite models too is that we're able to run\nit against last year's tournaments and see what the expected outputs\ncould be, and really help train that model heading into the tournament. Because as we talked about in the\nbeginning is, we can plan, plan, plan, but once two players get\non court, the outcome is unknown. So how do we really run it through its\npaces, and really make sure that whatever that outcome could be, and whatever\nthat scenario is, whether it's a fifth set tie-break that happens, or maybe\nthere's a fault at the end the match or something that we're not anticipating,\nthat we have that accounted for, and that the A won't throw off that output. So we really try to think through every\nscenario, which is sometimes difficult because again, live sports is the unknown,\nis the unknown, that's what makes it fun. We do spend a lot of time thinking\nthrough potential scenarios, and ensuring that we have the right data\nsets and the model to predict that. Jacob: Tell me about Match Reports and the\ngenerative AI model you're using for that. Brian: So Match Reports will be new for\nus this year, so we're in testing right now, so we're really excited around it. But the model that we'll be able use\nusing watsonx will use a bunch of different parts of the suite of tools,\nmeaning that again, taking some of that punditry and the unstructured\ndata and the editorial spin, it'll take our structured data as well. And really what we're working on\nright now is figuring out the right prompts for the AI to really ensure\nthat it tells the right structured story, meaning what just happened. So a recap is pretty standard. Here's what the data's telling us,\nwho won, who lost how many sets? Here's the score. Jacob: That's the structured data part. That's the easy part. Brian: And then really where it\ngets exciting is then, what does this mean, meaning, what's upcoming? So there's all these different\nscenarios when you get into 254 players and a large draw, this allows\nus to distill that down and really tell what could happen upcoming. The AI helps us do that at scale. Jacob: So I want to generalize for a\nmoment to talk about broader challenges with AI and how you've solved them. A lot of generative AI pilots fail because\nthe data quality isn't high enough, because the risk controls aren't there. And so I'm curious how you dealt with\nthose problems, and are dealing with them. Brian: Data quality, again, we feel\ncalm with the data that is supplied from the US Open and from the USTA, right? So we have, again, that's our\nstructured scoring data and all of that. I think what we're constantly\nlooking at is when we get outside of our known sources and out to third\nparties, is that's where a lot of the testing and model work happens. So we pull in different data\nsources and really try to work through how it changes that output. Again, some of that comes down to\nwhere it's an open model and the transparency that we have, and\nthe learning that comes behind it. That's where a lot of that confidence\ncan come from, and it comes from a lot of testing and feeding it more data. Your second question was a little bit\nmore around the output, I believe, right? Jacob: And risks, right? So risks, I think of risks\nmore in terms of output, right? Brian: Yeah. Jacob: The obvious fear is like,\nwhat if it says something wrong, or inflammatory, or whatever. That seems scary. Brian: Yeah, it definitely is, and\nit was definitely one of our largest concerns when we first took this foray. I would say a lot of that comes\nthrough our work with IBM and the IBM consulting team, and really ensuring\nthat, again, they're an extension in the partnership there of our team. So whenever we are creating, let's\nsay it's the Match Report, and we're going to be creating these succinct\narticles for every single men's and women's single match that happens, is\nall of those will have manual review, and people looking through them for\naccuracy to ensure that the model didn't hallucinate or make up a fact, or\nfill in the gaps and things like that. That's the first step. And then also when our editorial team\ngoes to publish those to the website, they're going to be checking it as well. So there are manual interventions\nthroughout that to really check that model, but we feel that the ability\nto do it at scale and with us more to check that, is the efficiency problem\nthat we've been looking to solve. Jacob: So the USTA and IBM have been\nworking together on digital innovation for like 30 years, from the first\nwebsite for the USTA until now. So that's the past 30 years. If you look ahead, what's the next 30? Brian: 30 years is a really long time. Jacob: How about three? Brian: Yeah. I think where I get excited, and I\nalluded to it in the beginning about how I feel like we're just scratching at\nthe surface, especially with generative AI and where I see it going is, there's\na lot of different fans out there. And we're also very cognizant of the\nUS Open that we're a worldwide event, and that there's a lot of different\nfans that we're not necessarily creating content for bespoke. Meaning, in their native language,\nor maybe it's in that native player's language, and things like that is... Where I get excited is we've seen immense\ngrowth with AI highlights, and the ability to now do highlights at scale\nis the ability for us to start creating content in different languages, maybe\ncovering different parts of the match. So maybe you do have that stats junkie\nwho really wants just, it's the fastest serve and here's the deep insights,\nversus the casual fan who's looking for more of the storytelling around how\na player trains, and what leading up to it was like, and what it means for\nthem afterwards, and things like that. A lot of that takes a lot of time. Now we're able to solve that efficiency\nproblem and do it in multiple languages. We can really create, I want to say\npersonalized content to a lot more fans all around the world which, again,\nhelps us grow the sport of tennis. Jacob: Great. So I want to finish with the speed round. Brian: Okay. Jacob: Are you ready? Brian: I am ready. Jacob: Okay. First thing that comes to\nmind, complete this sentence. In five years, AI will- Brian: Transform many\nparts of the business. Jacob: What is the number one thing\nthat people misunderstand about AI? Brian: That it's\nsupplemental, not replacing. Meaning that it helps with\nefficiencies, but it doesn't necessarily replace the creativity right now. Jacob: What advice would you\ngive yourself 10 years ago to better prepare you for today? Brian: I think it would've been,\nespecially now that we're able to take so much of that unstructured\ndata and pass content that we... Were created to help tell stories,\nwas to, I want to say archive more of that in a way that we could be\nusing that to help pull from that now. So we've seen kind of a change in\nthe guard from some of our star players to now new and up and comers,\nand it would be really fascinating to me if there was a way to cross\nsection some of that and saying what trajectories are certain up and coming\nplayers may be following from others. So it's more, I wish we kept more\nof the content we created back- Jacob: Save the data. Brian: Yeah, exactly. Jacob: That's what you're\ntelling yourself, save the data. Brian: Exactly. Jacob: Well, are you saving it all now? Brian: Oh yeah, 100%,\nwe learned our lesson. Yes, yes. Jacob: Okay. So on the business side of AI, what\ndo you think is the next big thing? Brian: I alluded to it earlier. I think it's personalization and\ngetting content that's catered to you at scale, whether that's across\nthe sports sphere, or any type of written content or news content. I feel like the ability to really\nget [inaudible] to the type of fan you are and the insights you\nhave is where we're all headed. Jacob: And in terms of your non-work\nlife, how do you use AI day to day? Brian: It's funny, I was just having\nthis conversation with a friend the other day and we were talking about\nthat sometimes when you're starting something new, the hardest thing to do\nis you have a blank piece of paper or a thought, and how do you get started? Sometimes with these generative models,\nthe easiest thing and the best thing you can do is it helps you get started. Meaning it may not be a hundred\npercent with that first prompt, but it's that efficiency of, whether it's\nan outline for a new idea, or it's a marketing brief you have to write. Or sometimes even if it's an email you\nhave to write for a personal something and you're not sure how to word it\nthe right way, it allows you to have a start, and then you can edit from there. So again, going back to my efficiency\npoint, it helps you become more efficient. Jacob: It solves the blank page problem. Brian: It does. Jacob: Brian, it was\ngreat to talk with you. Thank you so much for your time. Brian: Yeah, this was fun. Thanks for having me. [MG OUTRO] Malcolm: A huge thanks to Jacob\nand Brian for the deep dive into the cutting-edge innovations\ntransforming the game of tennis. Brian shed light on how the US\nOpen’s Partnership with IBM is harnessing data-driven insights to\nreshape storytelling in sports, from AI-generated commentary to match reports. As we look ahead, I’m excited about\nthe possibilities for personalizing content and reaching fans in new ways. The future of AI promises more\nthan just efficiency—it's about enhancing fan experiences worldwide.
