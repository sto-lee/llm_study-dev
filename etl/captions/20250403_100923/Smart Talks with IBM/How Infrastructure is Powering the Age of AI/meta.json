I'm a hardware guy. I grew up doing hardware chip engineering. But like I tell a lot of people, a\nchip engineering project is actually a giant software project with a piece\nof hardware at the end of the project. I think if you have that analytical\nbrain, you like to solve problems. You like to get things working. Um, you can do that in\nsoftware and hardware. But does that, but does being\nsomeone coming from a hardware background mean that you think\nabout problems in a different way? I think one thing that you do\nfrom a hardware background and especially a chip background is a\nchip spin costs millions of dollars. So you're a lot more likely to make\nsure everything has a great chance of being perfect from the get go. Where if you start kind of from a software\nbackground, your general mindset is, I don't know, try this, see if it works. I don't know, try that\nand see if it works. And you're kind of\niterate, iterate, iterate. Chip people are a little\nmore uptight about, okay. If, if this first round of the\nchip breaks costs us for building another new round of the chip. So you're a little more, you, you guys\nare, spend more time planning and… Planning, verifying. Tons of time verifying Yeah, so you began your\ncareer at Hewlett Packard. Yes, correct. And you were there for how many years? I was there for 32 years. And your last job there was? I was leading the software\ndefining cloud business. I had grown up a hardware guy. I had done all kinds of hardware\nprojects, big complicated Unix servers and things like that. Um, and then came, you know, grew out of\nR and D and more into the business realm. And then, uh, I'm much\nan innovator at heart. I really like innovating new,\nuh, concepts, things like that. And what I learned is I enjoyed\ninnovating business models and software projects as much as I did hardware\nproducts and projects and so getting teams inspired toward doing that was\nreally a deep fascination for me. So I ended up doing a fantastic variety\nof experiences and had a successful run and honestly retired, intending\nto retire and do some of my outside activities and things like that. And then how long did you stay\nretired before IBM came calling? It was almost two years. And when I first got the call, I\nthought, no, I'm having too much fun. Um, but I would say three things\nreally got me thinking hard about it. One: the industry that\nwe're in, the IT Industry. I think it's the golden age. And what I mean by that is for\n20 years of that career, IT's kind of in the back office. \"Hey, make sure that stuff doesn't\ncrash, and can you please reduce the cost as much as possible? Because\nit's not that important to the main business. It's just a back office\nfunction.” You can see it right now. IT is at the forefront of\nall business revolution. It happened with the Internet. Uh, it happened again with cloud and, and\nhow that changed every ounce of business, not just IT Business, but all business. And I think it's happening again with AI. So to be in that career that long and\nto miss the kind of this age where it's like this is front and center. This changes everything\nabout all businesses, not just technology businesses. I was kind of feeling like, gosh,\nyou, you train to be in these really, uh, awesome environments. Why wouldn't you do that for a little\nwhile longer while you still can do it? That combined with IBM and IBM seeing the\ntalent pool, the brilliant people at IBM. Um, I worked with a ton of\nbrilliant people before. I saw a chance to work with even a\nlarger staff of brilliant people. And then the assets that IBM had,\nwhich is, you know, they'd already been doing a lot of experimentation in AI. They're working in, in quantum, the deep,\nrich heritage of successful projects. I thought who wouldn't want to\nkind of see if they could be part of that next great wave of IBM. And so, um, I kind of decided, all right,\nI'm going to put the outside interests on hold for a while and get back in the game. How long between the phone call, the\nfirst phone call, and you saying yes? It was a while. It was probably six months. Arvind, our CEO, teases\nme about that a lot. Yeah, I don't think six\nmonths is that long. It took a while. You were in retirement! I know exactly. I mean, it's one thing to compare. I'm working here and doing this\nstuff versus working there. But it's really hard to compare. I'm doing exactly as I want to do\nevery single day when I wake up. And now I'm not going\nto get to do that again. Um, it took a while for me to get over it. And I thought, I can't miss this wave. And, and, uh, I'm really, really\nhappy that I did because we're doing some amazing, fun things. And I'm getting challenged\nin ways that I never did. So it's really fun. Talk a little bit about your\njob here at IBM, you oversee a kind of massive portfolio It's a big group. So I run the infrastructure organization. There's three main groups\nof products at IBM. There's the infrastructure\ngroup, which I run. The software group, uh,\nand the consulting group. Um, and infrastructure is\nbuilt up of mainframes, which is called our Z portfolio. Um, our servers, which\nis our power portfolio. Storage. By the way, those businesses include the\nsupply chain to build all of that stuff. So that's in the group. Uh, then I have the worldwide\ncustomer support organization. It's called, uh, TLS Technology Lifecycle\nServices, which is a network of about 13,000 people around the globe that\nmake sure that everything runs and works when you buy IBM products and then also\nour IBM cloud, which is, um, how we, uh, host applications, deliver as a\nservice products for our client base. So there's a lot. It's, I think it's about\n45,000 people total. Do those, uh, components of\nthe infrastructure group? Are they aligned in their trajectory? Or do they, are they on different paths? I'm just curious about sort of navigating… A little of both. It's interesting you would ask\nthat, because I think of all of the challenges coming to the new company. There were things I expected,\nthings that I didn't expect, but getting that culture right in the\ngroup, um, has been a big challenge. Um, IBM has a great culture toward quality\nproducts, toward, um, emphasizing passion for the client, and making sure that\nthe client is happy, and for delivering innovation on a scale that, that, you\nknow, for more than a hundred years has, has been, um, extremely powerful. But with success comes some challenges. And with that success, you can tend to get\na little bit, um, insular, like you don't keep an eye on the competition as well. You can get more siloed where you\nknow this is my business unit. This is my business unit. I compete with the other business unit. That's not a good thing when you, when\nyou're a company, um, and you can get really risk averse, meaning you, you\nfeel like, “Hey, this is a successful business. I don't want to do anything to\nmess it up. So I don't need to try new things.” Well, that's exactly the recipe\nto kind of be shrinking and infrastructure had been shrinking for a little while. And so a lot of what, um, the challenge\nwas for me was to invigorate that risk taking and, and, uh, get to a growth\nmindset where you're trying new things and seeing what works and what doesn't\nwork and changing some of the models, like investing a little bit less in\nhardware for some software differentiation that goes into the hardware. So, um, it's been very successful\nso far and it's been a good journey. It's almost four years now. Give me an example of what was a\nreally hard problem that you've dealt with in those four years. Boy, a really hard problem. Or an interesting. Interesting is a better word than hard. One of the first things that I kind\nof chewed on a little bit is, I talked about how we have Z power and storage. The Z and power product lines are well\nknown in the industry as really fit for purpose computing that have strengths,\nthat, you know, Z runs, um, you know, most of the world's economic backbone. And, and, uh, if you use a credit card,\n90 percent of credit card transactions for the globe go through these Z mainframes. They're in every bank there,\nyou know, it's a big business. It's well known in the industry. Same with power, very tuned and optimized\nfor, for smaller operations than, than our giant Z mainframes, but really,\nmission critical workloads for retail, for insurance, for banking, for all of that. Our storage business - not so well known. In fact, when I came, I\nthought, did they have storage? Will I have storage when I come into IBM? So I got online and I thought\nit's still hard for me to tell, do they have storage or not? Now I own a storage business. So one of the things was not just to get\nthe market perception up, but to invest in that business, because if you look\nat infrastructure overall around the globe, it's growing at 5 percent a year. The infrastructure business had\nbeen kind of flat to declining. And so a challenge was how\ndo we grab onto the growth? Well, one of the biggest growth\nareas, due to the explosion of data, in the world is storage. So what do you do to kind\nof get on that growth rates? We did a lot of reinvigoration\nof the innovation in that, a lot of software value add, a lot of\ndoubling down on the things that are working portfolio rationalization\nwhere you segment the market. You say, “Okay, we're going to do less\nof this and really go big in these areas.” And that's been probably the most\ndramatic turnaround inside the group is, is our storage thing. When you say it's\na hard problem, it's not just, “Oh, you know, how do we do the math?” No, it's,\nit's cultural, it's, it's strategy. And how do you get the strategy said. It's segmentation, it's product\nstrategy at a granular level across a bunch of dimensions and then\nputting the investment behind it. Um, it's a big challenge. It takes a long time, but it's working. So we're happy. Yeah. Tell me, give me a little\nbit of perspective on you've been there four years. Imagine we're having this\nconversation four years ago. Yeah. What sorts of things have happened\nover the last four years that, uh, have surprised you that you didn't see\ncome or at least, are we having exactly the same conversation four years ago? Um, no, because I didn't know\nwhat was in, I'll tell you some of the biggest surprises. I thought from the outside and, and\nyou know, you, you hear from a lot of customers, especially 10 years ago. “We're all going to\ncloud.” We're all doing. So I thought, Well, I wonder if the\nmainframe business is struggling when I get inside of there. I found the opposite to be true. The mainframe business is\nactually flourishing because transaction demand across the\nglobe has done nothing but grow. And even more surprising was the\nlevel of innovation that the team was already doing in mainframes\nbefore I got here was astounding. For example, we have AI they were\nbuilding AI technology into the mainframe processors three years before ChatGPT made\neverybody talk about it in the industry. So, um, that was really\npleasantly surprising. So that was wonderful. Um, other surprises. I knew about the kind of the IP\nof IBM and the mystique in that. And I used to joke with people,\nespecially on the outside. I said, I can't wait to get in there\nand see what's in the big blue toolbox. Right? What are all the things\nthey have going on? I way underestimated the size of the\nbig blue toolbox and what was in there. Meaning, um, the amount of really\nhardcore research that we're still doing into how to build chips and, and how\nto get to things beyond two nanometer and, and that kind of capability. Packaging, industry leading\npackaging technologies, um. That's in my hardware kind of patch. Quantum. The next thing that'll come after\nwe're done talking about AI, um, you know, all of, all of those things were\nsurprising, but it wasn't just that. It was then the software\ninnovations that are going on. Heavy investment in AI technologies\nbefore it was really popular to be talking about that. But as I saw that, I thought,\nthis is going to get really fun because I had a good feel for\nwhere the industry was going. I just didn't. And I knew, man, I know that talent is\nreally good and there's brilliant people there, but I didn't know the level\nof, of IP, frankly that, that IBM had at its disposal and now you're seeing\nthat in things like watsonx and things like AI in, in mainframes, et cetera. Building on that, since you brought\nup AI, can you walk me through what has to happen from your perspective,\nfrom the infrastructure perspective to make the AI explosion work? So everyone wants to\ndo more of this stuff. Clearly there has to be\nsome underpinning of it. Yeah, I would tell you, you know I think\nthat people feel like where we're at right now in the AI journey had to do\nwith one specific piece of software. I think the inflection point\nfor that whole thing really, at its root was around hardware. Meaning the algorithms needed\nto do large language models and all of that had been around. They've been talked about in the\nindustry, but at some point you hit a tipping point of, of hardware\ncapability where it's like, oh, now we can do this in a brute force way. Massive amounts of matrix math to get\nweights correct so that you can do, um, you know, the right level of predictions\nthat enable large language models. And once we've got to that horsepower,\nand that's why you hear about giant GPUs that are driving this\nand the sales of those, et cetera. It's because we just barely got\nover the hump where you can do these big, hard things in terms\nof hardware capability to do it. Give me a layman, give me a\nsense of when you say there was a kind of threshold where suddenly\nthese things became possible. I don't know if there's an exact number,\nbut, more basic question that I get from a lot of people, you know, my\nfriends and family outside, is why GPUs? What does, what does a GPU\ngraphics processor have to do? With AI, it's not. Well, graphics processors are really\ngood at this thing matrix math because they're figuring out how do I map a pixel? And as I move an object across\nthe screen, it's essentially matrix math to figure out. Okay, what is what is what is this\npixel on the screen look like? And what's it doing? And as you know, we've gotten more\nhigh resolution graphics, more high resolution monitors, et cetera. It's a lot more pixels and a lot\nmore math and a lot more matrix math about how you compute that. The first big thing that kind of\nstarted to look like that, it turns out was crypto and crypto mining. And so you saw graphics companies\nstarting to sell to crypto. The technology got to a certain\npoint and there were use cases like Bitcoin and that, that, that kind of\nsaid, \"Hey, we need to do a lot of this matrix math to, to be able to\ndo that.\" Um, so graphic chips were a natural fit and that kind of sustained. But meanwhile, behind the\nscenes, a lot of this AI. AI is about numeric calculations having\nto do with weights and matrices that say, you know, giant consolidated things that\npredict what's going to kind of happen based on, what other things have happened,\njust like predicting where a Pixel goes, but it's really about being able to do\nenough data ingest to be able to do, and then the calculations to be able\nto simplify things like entire sets of language or giant chunks of the internet\nto get enough weightings in there to be able to say, okay, we can predict what you\nwould say in this language based on all of the volumes of stuff that we've seen\nthat when you start talking like this, the next word is likely, oh, it's this. So- But my point is, to get to that point,\nthat threshold, we got there because, was it because we simply threw a\nlot more resources at the problem? Or is it because the underlying\ntechnology got suddenly or gradually so much more efficient? It's always yes and yes, but you\nknow, uh, the industry for a lot of years would talk about Moore's Law. Rick, quick, will you define\nfor us, uh, Moore's Law, for those who've forgotten it? Yeah, so, uh, Gordon Moore at Intel\ncoined this thing, it was basically that the horsepower, I'm going to\ntranslate it roughly of, uh, technology will double every couple of years. We’re still on Moore's Law. Moore's Law changed a little bit. For a while, it was\nalways about frequency. Things would go faster, faster, faster. That kind of petered out. But what happened is rather\nthan faster, faster, faster, we did more and more and more. So rather than one operating unit\ngoing a lot faster on its throughput, you put 10 operating units on a chip. Now you put 100 operating units on a chip. Now 1000. Some of these problems, the matrix math\nproblems, scale parallel extremely well. You don't have to do\nsomething really fast. You just have to do a lot of the similar\nthings in parallel at the same time. So again, that kind of that, extension\nof Moore's Law, more and more hardware on a chip to be able to do more\nand more of those calculations in parallel and come up with answers. Was that threshold predictable? In other words, did people in the\nindustry like you sit down X number of years ago and say, when we get here,\nAI is going to become much more of a? It's funny. The horsepower - that - very predictable. The use cases, not always so\neasy to kind of figure out. That's where the human\nspirit kind of gets involved. Um, I think for some people they\nsay, “Oh, I saw that coming.” But people have been predicting kind\nof the rise of AI for 25 years. Oh, well, then when we get to\nthis next gen or when we get here. It kind of hadn't happened. There's always a magic point where you\nkind of get to where the technology and the use case, and somebody does\nsomething to kind of make it catch on. And I think we're at one of those\nmoments in AI for sure right now. And I don't think it's you\nknow, people have said, Oh, this is just the latest wave of. You know, uh, I used to hear,\nI've heard this about a lot of technologies, but AI is the technology,\nthe future, and it always will be. I used to hear that. Um, you're not hearing that now, right? It's like, no, it's prime time. It will change everything. Just like some of these other\nthings changed everything. I noticed sort of personally,\nwhen I speak somewhere where I'm listening in an audience somewhere\nover the last, let's say 12 months. There is always a whole\nbunch of AI questions. Yes. And if I go back two years ago,\nthere were no AI questions. Yes. Now, my question is, so there's been\nthis explosion on the, in popular fascination with what's going on AI. It seems like the last year. I agree with you. In your world. When did the explosion of\nconversation around this start? It's, uh, I love this question because. IBM had a, um, fairly big\neffort and business, um, called Watson before watsonx. And this is going back kind of ten years. I'll give you another kind of example. I knew about a lot of tablet\ntechnology before there was an iPad. A lot. For 10 years, there were a lot. But it kind of takes a magic\ncombination of the technology, the user experience, the software, and\nthe need and the market ready for it to kind of go, now it's a thing. Now we all have either an iPad or we\nhave the Google equivalent, And so I think this is a little like that, meaning\nIBM was on the right track with watson. Some of the hardware wasn't there. The use cases weren't exactly figured out. Some of the early use cases\ndidn't pan out perfectly. But the good news about that is it's\nback to that culture of risk taking. You don't look back on that and say,\n“Oh, we shouldn't have done that. That was a bad idea.” No, you look back\non that and say, “What did we learn? How should we try something new? How would we pivot this time?” That's\nwhat we've done with watsonx and uh, now that's a growing healthy\npiece of our business and very important to our strategic future. So we're all in. I mean, I've just, I've always\nbeen fascinated by the gap between insider sense of what is\nhappening and outsider sense, like… It absolutely is that in this case,\nwe've all been talking about and thinking about AI and, and is it time for that? And what does this mean? Et cetera. And yet none of us really predicted\nthat actual moment, which is kind of, you know, early 2022 where it\nwas like, Oh, now you have a simple human interface of software innovation\ncombined with large language models. There's a moment there where you're\nlike, Oh, unlike, you know, I think all of us are frustrated if we ask\nour phone, “Hey, tell me about this.” And it says, “I found this on the\nweb page.” That does, you know, good. But, you know, all of a sudden with\nwith, um, ChatGPT and some of these other things, you could ask a question. It would give you a clear answer. Sometimes it's wrong, but at least\nit was like I'm getting an answer rather than, “Hey, I don't know.\nHere's some references. Good luck to you.” And that's really changing. Talk about the kind of macro\ntrends that are going to shape your infrastructure battle Yeah. Um, we've talked about a few\nalready, but I'm actually going to go a little different direction. So macro trends first, and\nthis one has been before even, even this AI conversation that\nwe've had: explosion of data. Uh, as humans, we don't think\nexponentially very well. We really struggle with\nexponential thinking. We think linearly. Oh, there'll be more. There'll be more. There'll be more. But we don't think, well, when\nit's like, no, there'll be more and there'll be 10 times more and then\nthere'll be 10 times that more. That's what's going on with\ndata right now in our industry. It's one of the reasons that that\nstorage business is doing so well, is there’s just more and more and more data. Um, you know, you'd say, well,\nhow can there be more data? It's just life and that thing. The things that we care\nabout: video capture, video images, you know, the thing. I don't know. For my parents, you needed a\ndrawer with all your family photos. Now we need gigabytes and gigabytes. If you knew how many pictures my wife\nhas taken of our children, you would. Exactly, exactly so that,\nso that's your case. Now think of companies who used to just\nthink about their transaction data. What's the ledger say? That now have video assets of all of\ntheir campaigns and their marketing. They're trying to figure out, you know\nwhat campaigns are working the best. It's just an explosion of data. And that's not going to stop. Dealing with that, and more importantly,\ngetting value from that data is, is a massive trend in the industry. Second trend, AI. And this is the AI, not like we\nwere just talking about, about how it changes how I search for\nthings or how I learn about things. But I would argue dealing with that data. How do I figure out what's\nin all those video streams? How do I figure out - Okay, I want all\nof the chunks of my corporate video that have to do with, uh, client buying\nsome specific product or something. That's a different problem. It's not just, okay we'll look it\nup in a spreadsheet, and here's the math associated with that. That is a huge trend in the industry. You're seeing it play out in this regard. It's a little different bent on AI. Fraud detection is the one that\nwe cite in our main frames. It's a similar problem where it was\nkind of a traditional AI problem. Look up a rule, you know, if somebody\ndoes too small transactions, then a massive one, it might be fraud, right? Because they were seeing\nwhether it worked. Now to detect fraud, you might be saying,\nokay, two transactions, then a huge one. Plus, does this entity\nhave a real address? Second, is there any web traffic on,\nyou know, better business bureau kind of things that says this is a bad\nbusiness that could help you with fraud. So it's a lot more of a,\nit's an exponential problem. It's a holistic problem that takes a\nlot more than just, you know, little chunks of rules, etc. And then the\nthird one, you know, after AI is the nature of hybrid IT or hybrid computing. For a while, 10 years ago, when cloud\nwas on the rise, I think, the notion of hybrid computing basically having\nto do with things in the cloud versus things that people still have, um,\non the premises inside a business. It was almost a religious argument. Now it's no, it's the reality. And the reason is because that data that\nI talked about is the lifeblood of these companies, particularly IBM's companies. Our clients that usually\nthat data has to be secure. They have to be able to get value from it. It is the lifeblood of the company. If you go to an A. T. M. And you\ncan't get your money out, you know, to our financial transactions. If that lasts a day, you're probably\ngoing to change banks immediate. So it's like life or\ndeath to these companies. So having that hybrid infrastructure\nso that they can still hold their data yet still interact with clouds\nand still get value from it from AI. That's a kind of the magic where we play,\nand it's a huge business opportunity. It is a true inflection\npoint for the industry. Mhmm. I'm gonna go back. I interrupted you when you were in the\nmiddle of a really, we were talking about what has to happen for, um, for AI to\nscale from the infrastructure standpoint. You gave one example then\nI got you off on a tangent. Can you go back and talk? Very sort of practically, like. So I'm, you know, I'm a big company. I have all these dreams of AI of how\nI'm going to use this dramatically. So give me a very granular\nsense of the works you have to do to make that dream possible. So let me first say what\nthe company has to do. And then maybe I'll say then how do\nI help them, if that makes sense. So if I'm a company and I want to do that. So it turns out I am a company, meaning\nI want to use AI in my processes. I mentioned that I have a global network\nof 13,000 employees that support our infrastructure around the world. That challenge is a\ngreat challenge for AI. That means I have data for every\ncustomer situation for 13,000 employees globally around the\nworld on what was their problem? How did we fix it? Um, what next steps did they have to do? How did they remediate that? That data is extremely valuable to\nme because if I can get better at doing that than anybody else in the\nworld, that brings my cost down. I sell more products. I sell more service. I sell more anything. So what I have to do to get\nthere is I have to figure out, okay, what's my objective? I have a couple objectives. One, I want customers to be able to\nsupport themselves without even calling me first off, and I don't want when they,\nwhen they call for the first answer to come back to be, did you try rebooting? Because I think that irritates\nevery single one of us. Did you try? “Of course, I tried rebooting. I've had a\nlaptop my entire life. Of course.” Well, okay, well, then tell me, okay, what\nfirmware version, all that other stuff. Okay, we know this interaction. So, you know, So that's\nkind of the problem set. Do I want that to be customers\nsolving their own problems? Well, even for my support agents, I\nwant something in their pocket on their phone where they say I'm seeing these\nsymptoms and says, “Oh, this happened in around the globe. Here's here's kind\nof specific.” So there's my problem. And what does it mean for for\ninfrastructure on the back end? So first, I got to get all\nthat data together, right? All of those customer law, all that\ncustomer support around the globe, et cetera, that needs to be stored. That's a big set of data. And some of it's not just fix\nand, and that kind of thing. Some of it is okay. You know, what was the firmware version? Who was the tech? Cause it can matter. Is this their first time\nfixing this problem? Is it their 150th time? What's their level? It's a very complicated problem. Ingesting all that data\ntakes an architecture. We have a product called Scale,\num, which is one of our storage projects that actually makes it\neasy to ingest all that data, get it organized, etc. And then have a model. It's a whole different process to\nkind of say, did we train our model? We train our own models inside of IBM. We have a Granite set of models. Those models we fine tune and then\nwe inference based on those models. So we can do that\ninferencing in our cloud. I have a cloud set of infrastructure\nor in my power servers. We can do inferencing with our\ncapabilities and say, OK, based on what I'm saying, here's what the remediation\nthat you should do for that customer. We already are doing that today. We've seen, um, over a third of our\nsupport calls have had significant reduction in the amount of time that\nit takes to resolve that support call just by what I said right there. Does that I've really\nbeen curious about this. If I had reduced something like AI into\nthat equation, as you just did, and you said, we've already seen a 30 percent,\nyou say, did you say 30 percent reduction? 30 percent of our interactions have\nseen significant reduction in the time Was that your primary goal to\nreduce the time of the interaction? In other words, if you, if everything\nelse was the same, but all, but what you were doing was shrinking the amount of\ntime that, would you declare victory? One of the primary goals. So, to us in that business, uh, net\npromoter score, kind of the satisfaction of a client is the supreme goal. What makes them satisfied? Doesn't cost me a fortune,\nhappens really quickly. And if I can do it\nmyself, I'd be thrilled. It affects all of those, right? It kind of says it got resolved faster. It didn't cost me an arm and a leg\nbecause the tech was barely here because it's a common problem. Or I solved it myself\nwithout even calling one. So, um, all of those objectives we kind\nof hit across all so that now you see it. So that's a little microcosm. That's just me and my\ncustomer support business. Now think of how many problems\nfor businesses around the world there are like that. It's not a, it's not like a\nnew AI application that changes the entire user experience. That's, those will come, but right now\nit's kind of practical, which is, I just want to do what I'm doing better\nand faster, and I can get immediate economic return from those things. How long, how long did it take you\nto just stick with that example of the customer interaction, reducing 30\npercent of the time, how long from the very beginning of that project to that\n30 percent reduction was how long? Uh, less than a year. And. Yeah. So we, one of the challenges, and\nthis is interesting with a very large organization, as you can imagine, just\nlike you're seeing in the industry, we don't have a problem of generating\nideas for how AI could help us. We actually have a problem filtering\nthe thousands of ideas from our employees and from, from everywhere. It's like, Hey, we could use AI to solve\nand filtering down and saying, okay, which of these will have a return on investment\nquickly and at a level that sustains that that's worth kind of going and investing\nin the infrastructure and and, uh, the software and kind of making that happen. Is that unusual? If I talked to you 25 years ago\nand said, do you have a problem of too many good ideas or too few? What would you have said? Um, in this specific area, probably\ntoo few because at some point you reach diminishing return. So, for example, let's use\nthis exact same example. Can those 13, 000 technicians go faster? Can they spend less time\ndriving to the site? I mean, there's only so much you\ncan kind of do on those things. But if you can get them an answer\nto the problem and maybe even avoid them having to visit at all because\nthe client helped themselves. That's a step function. So this, that's why people\nare kind of talking about. There's a, there's a business revolution\ncoming with AI where there's some step function changes that can be there. And notice I didn't say I'm going\nto have less of those agents. That's not my objective. My objective. And I think that's the fear in\nthe industry about AI is going to eliminate all the jobs. No, I just created 13,000 super\npowered agents that can do more. Right? And so I'm not just going\nto support IBM products. I'm going to go out and support\nother people's products because I know how to do that really well. And once I have the data on how\nto fix their problems, I may just have a customer support business\nthat's independent of my boxes. So, you know, I think that's where people\nsometimes get it wrong in the AI thing is, it's like, you know, did, did word\nprocessing eliminate the need for writers? No, it enabled writing instead of\nmucking around with mimeograph machines and clickety click typewriters. It may have enabled too much writing. Yeah, maybe, maybe. Wait, can I give you a hypothetical? I ask this because I ran. I was at some conference and I ran\nto some guy from the IRS. He was really, really, really, really\nexcited about AI So let's suppose they call you up and they say… You're gonna talk, to ask me\nwhen the IRS. calls me up I'm the commissioner of the IRS.\nI call you up and I say, “Rick, uh, clearly there's something that we could\ndo for the IRS. if we work together.” Yeah.\nWhat would your answer be? Of course. No, I think, we sell to a lot of\ngovernment agencies, as you can imagine in, in the business that we're in. We enable a lot of social security\ntransactions and things like that through our mainframes. And I think, you know, we're in the\nbusiness of helping whatever client get the most out of their data and\nbe able to secure it and and be able to do analytics with this. And IRS. has a heck of a lot of data. So yes, we would help them. Do you know how the amount of\ndata they have compares to some of the corporate clients you have? I don't know specifically for the\nIRS. how much data they have, but I would assume it's a whole lot. It's mountains. But, but that's our business. I mean, it's interesting. Sometimes, people have asked what's\nthe most, you know, what is it that IBM has that's of great value? Is it a server? Is it a storage array? Is it, you know, software and all that? What we have is the most\nimportant entities in the world have their data on our stuff. The most important data in the world. It's not, you know, You know,\npictures of your grandkids and things like that, generally for us. It's all of the financial transactions\nthat happen globally, right? It's all of the it's the world's economy\nis kind of running through our systems. And so we take that really seriously. You know, you would be distraught if you\nlost one photo on your laptop, whatever. But, you know, if we lose a\ntransaction, like somebody moves a big amount of money, and it's like,\nwell, don't know what happened there. It is a massive deal, right? So that doesn't happen. I wanna go back to my\nIRS. example for a moment. Yes. So, one, is it reasonable to assume\nthat, uh, you could, that somebody, IBM or somebody else, could in a short\nperiod of time put together, not just the AI capability to audit returns, but\nalso this, the infrastructure support for that in a reasonable amount of\ntime for a reasonable amount of cost? Or is it a, over, is it going to the moon? Or is it…. It definitely, I mean, So we're already\ndoing that kind of thing right across a network of, of banks and others. Yeah Essentially all credit card\ntransactions for all of the world go through our systems. So that in some ways is more volume\nthan the tax returns of the U.S. people and their you know, W2s and all that. Yeah, and we do that stuff, too. I try not to describe it\ntoo much in detail, but we definitely do a lot of that. Um, in fact, I think, um, most,\nif you think, okay, what is super critical data, who would be doing\nthe business transaction processing? It is most likely us, in almost all cases,\nwhether it's government things or, or private or banks or that kind of thing. That's what we do. Ric, we're gonna end with, uh,\nthe way we always end with a couple of quick fire questions. Okay. Here we go. Um, what single piece of advice\nwould you give to businesses trying to use AI in an effective way? The simple version is get started. By get started, I mean, think of what\nis something that I want to improve. The things that we have traction on\nright now in the market are around business process automation, digital\nlabor, uh, uh, those kinds of things. But my other little piece of advice\nthere is keep it simple to begin with. You're going to learn a lot,\nbut getting started means you'll start that learning curve. I even advise, you know, my friends\nlike, \"Hey, should I be playing around with some of this AI stuff?\" And I say,\nyeah, because I think it will help you start to be more comfortable and you\nmay find a use case personally for that. I think the same is true for businesses. The first step in that journey is always. With what data? Notice when I talked about our\ncustomer support people, I thought about, okay, what's the data? The data is all of those\nlogs, of all of those service engagements around the world. And what could I do with that? Well, I could use that to get to a\nknowledge base that really helps. Um, and hopefully that I can do it in\nmultiple languages because it's global and I can, you know, all of those things. That was kind of my data set. That one's not super simple, but\nwe've had a lot of experience in AI. For other people that might just be:\nHow do I automate filling out travel expense reports for my company? We can help people that\nwe have consulting. We have watsonx tools. We can do that like this and we're doing\nit globally for people around the world. Pick that thing. What's the data you have in that case? It's data of expense reports. And it's like, okay, we can help\nyou automate that for people where they could do it just by,\nyou know, a verbal interface. What did you spend? Where did you go? Who are you with? Okay, we filled out your\ntravel expense report for you. And you don't have to mess around with it. We were playing with this idea,\nwhere we would pick a business. And go in there and do,\nit would be AI makeover. Yeah, I love that idea. Okay, what's the, what is\nthe ideal business to do? We only have a couple months. We don't want to spend\na kajillion dollars. We want to be able to show tangibly\nand quickly what AI can do. What's an ideal business to do that in? It can be a small business,\nbut we're not talking. This isn't a grand corporate thing here. Boy, small business that\nwe could do an AI makeover. Customer support is one of my favorites\nbecause it's a, it's, it's, I have it on the business side where I provide\ncustomer support, but I have it on the consumer side where it drives me nuts\nwhen I have to go through 30 layers of phone menus and speak to an agent,\nspeak to an agent, speak to an agent. That for any business, I think is just\nripe to be able to kind of say, Why do I have to click through these menus message? I just need to tell you in human language. Here's the issue. And I'll be really good about telling\nyou details about, you know, I tried to set up this thing for my bank\nand I did... They can go through all the menus, automate that process. I think it would change everything\nbecause all that frustration as a consumer would go down dramatically. And it's all, you know, you know,\nwhy are you making me the beep, boop, press one, press five, press four? They’ve offloaded. Exactly. Well, don't offload to me. Offload to AI. We can help you with that. Here's my version of that. Drives me crazy. Every morning, I go to the\nsame coffee shop, and I get a cup of tea and a croissant. And here's what happens. A person has their screen,\nand they go, I go, cup of tea, croissant, sparkling water. Do, do, do, do, do like at\nleast 20 keystrokes, right? Yes, yes. And then like, then the screen is turned\naround like at this point we're like 45 seconds in and I'm like, why is\nthis, first of all, it's not for me. All those keystrokes. Yes.\nIt's for their internal Yes, yes. Correct, correct. So they're burdening me in\norder to service their backend. You should be able to walk in, go up\nand they go, “Hi, Malcolm. Same thing?” Yeah.\nAnd you just go, yes. And then… Boom, we're done. Can we do AI makeover of my coffee shop? You notice I quickly jumped more to\nbanks than your coffee shop because I think I'm a business person. I'm not trying to kind of do\na deal on one coffee shop. No, but this is interesting because\nit takes me back to something you said that I thought was really important. When you were talking about, when you\nwere using AI in your customer service thing, it was clear that your goal, you\ncould have any number of goals going in. It could be to cut costs. It could be to dramatically\nimproves profits. Your goal quite specifically\nwas to improve the experience of your customer, right? So you were using it to that. All the other things come\nfrom that come from that. And that is actually one of the\nbeautiful pillars of the IBM culture is delighting clients is actually\nwhere all of the good stuff comes from. Always. So my coffee shop thing is\nthe same principle right now. Right now, they're making my customer\nexperience worse, and they don't want to, but their eyes are glued to the screen. At a moment when I walk in and\nI want to say, “Hi, how are you doing?” We could have a conversation. They’re busy beeping and booping. They're too busy, beeping and booping. So like, this is the same thing. If they had their, Oh, we, this\nis if they understood they had an opportunity to improve the\nexperience, their customer experience. I would not be surprised if a\nchain comes along where that is their value proposition, I\nwould not be surprised at all. Right? So, I mean, and, and when\nthose things kind of catch hold, it becomes a revolution. You know, when, um, the guy comes to do\nlike to redo your roof and they put a sign out front like, you know, Joe's roofing. You guys could do the\nsame with my coffee shop. Put like “IBM Infrastructure was here.” Exactly. Um, in five years, the\nmainframe will be dot dot dot. Going strong. Uh, the mainframe going strong\nand with new capabilities, continuous new capabilities. I think when we announced\nthe last version, Z16, the latest version, I should say. And we said, “hey, there's AI processing\nbuilt into it.” This was before everybody was talking about that. I think a lot of people thought, “what's\nthat for?” And we did it specifically for traditional AI, fraud detection,\netc. This next version, not only do we have the traditional AI built in,\nbut we have optional cards that you can plug into it to allow you to do\nlarge language models for the enhanced fraud detection cases that we talked\nabout where, you know, it's more than just what transactions were happening. So if you take that and say,\nokay, the next generations. We have more transaction volume than\nwe've ever had in mainframes today. The business is growing. It's strong. We keep innovating. In five years it'll be going strong. But weren't people, you're\nsaying this in the context of. For years, people were\npredicting, weren't they, that the mainframe was going to go away? Uh, there were pundits in the market\nthat said everything will go away. No one will ever have a box. It'll all be online. I think this is something I've\nlearned big time in my long career, you know, uh, in the IT industry is\ndon't believe everything you hear. So I went back for my, uh, master's\ndegree at Stanford after I had worked a while in, in, uh, as a hardware designer. And everybody told me, be sure\nto do your master's in software. Hardware is dead. I went on to work for 30 plus years\nin hardware and infrastructure, now software became important. And I'm glad I had that extra training\nin software because it helped me in hardware, but hardware wasn't dead. Then I heard all infrastructure\nwill go into the cloud. There won't be any. That hasn't happened. It's not happening. Then I heard there will only be one cloud\nbecause one of the players will dominate. There's not one cloud. So I think it's as humans, we\nlike to oversimplify and go. Oh, it's all going to be this. And kind of what I've learned is fit\nfor purpose matters in everything. It matters in size of infrastructure. It matters in the stack that goes\nalong with solving a specific use case. If you're willing to design something\nthat's the best at that use case. If you're willing to design the\ncoffee shop that is the best at greeting me, there's a spot for you. And there may be a big\nbusiness in doing that. So oversimplifying is really dangerous. When you heard all those predictions. Did you, did you believe them at the time? Uh, they looked like they were\ntrending in that direction. I'll tell you some right\nnow, which might be useful. There will only be one GPU\ncompany, and they're gonna end up taking over the world. It's a pretty obvious answer whose\neconomic value has risen dramatically. I don't think that's gonna be the case. In fact, I think that 90\npercent of processing for AI actually happens at inferencing. And inferencing is not as GPU and hardware\nintensive as the other things, and is a lot more amenable to fit for purpose. So the model size will matter. The tuning matters a\nlot as we're learning. We have a product around InstructLab\nthat's really focused on tuning. So that was one thing\nis there'll be one GPU. The other thing is, that the biggest model\nwill win, I think, is another thing that's kind of, people are saying right now. I don't believe that. I believe there will be\nfit for purpose models. It takes a lot of money to run\na, to create a huge model, and then to run a huge model, or to\neven infer off of a huge model. I don't need a massive training\nGPU set thing to solve my 13, 000 people customer support issue. So why would I feel like I gotta go\nfarm that out for a big expensive thing? I can do that on a small box. In some cases, I might even be\nable to do that on a laptop. The other thing I'll say in this\nwe're so early innings in AI, a lot of things are going to change. So anybody kind of saying it will all\nbe X, Y or Z. I just think you have no idea how this is going to play out. And and it's up to us to go\nfigure out how it plays out. Yeah, yeah. Allright. In five years, AI will be dot dot dot Still new. it will have moved a bunch in five years. But the potential for the disruption\nin the world will still, will still be very early innings in that process. And I think that's super\nimportant to realize. That's why I say get started. Start thinking about how that\ncould change, because it will be some little things first, but\nit will continue to snowball. There's always this is a common\nobservation that we, the invention of the capability, uh, massively predates the\nunderstanding of the capability, right? Like I love that. Yes. Yeah, like recording shows on\ntelevision is invented in the sixties. Probably the VCR. We don't really understand what\nit's used for until the oughts. What it’s really good for is being\nable to tell a story sequentially Yes. …over time, because you know\nthat the person will all have seen the episode before. Yes.\nSo you get The Sopranos and… Yes. Yes. Hollywood wanted to ban\nthe VCR in the beginning. Because they thought the point of it…\nYes. They thought piracy. They didn't understand. No, no, no. It's storytelling. It's actually your\nbusiness is getting better. Yes, yes. Took them 20 years to figure\nthat out, which is to your point. Why would we know what\nAI was for in five years? Well, that's why you hear people\nkind of say, “Oh my gosh, AI, that's, that will just eliminate\njobs.” No, it'll make jobs better. That's how I view it. What's the number one thing that\npeople misunderstand about AI? Is that it? I think that's that that would be the\nhuman kind of understanding part of it. The technology part of it, I think,\nwould be what I was talking about fit for purpose, meaning, um, that it\nisn't just going to be a GPU arms race. All of AI. I don't believe that at all. It will change everything, but it's\nnot just going to be a GPU arms race. Yeah, uh, next question. What advice would you give yourself 10\nyears ago to better prepare you for today? I'm changing this question. Okay. I want to say, let's imagine\nthat, uh, what was your, what, what college did you go to? I went to three of them. My undergrad was Utah State University. My MBA was Santa Clara University and my\nmaster's in EE was Stanford University. Okay. Any one of those three calls you up\nand says, we want you to give the commencement address and imagine\nthat it's, it's, it's just, let's just say for the sake of argument,\nit's just to the STEM people because those are the relevant parties here. What do you tell them? Boy, what do I tell them? Uh, let's see. I think I would start with\nlife is a marathon, not a sprint would be the first one. Uh, the second thing I would say to that,\nin that spirit is, um, be sure to set yourself some big, hairy, audacious goals. And don't be overly disappointed\nif you don't hit them all. Going after those big, hairy,\naudacious goals will get you on a path where you will learn so much. You will achieve more than you ever\ncould imagine you would have achieved. That's what the advice I give to my kids\nis set some big goals, get after it. You may or may not achieve them,\nbut you'll be better for the whole process when you're done. By the way, as someone whose kids are a\nlot younger than yours, is it actually useful to give advice to your kids? Or is that just a pointless exercise? TBD. We're still on the journey, and I\nthink we will be for a long time. I don't know. How are you already using AI\nin your day to day life today? Uh, personally, I would say, it's\nreplacing a good chunk of my search. You know, I'm less likely to go\nblindly stumbling through a bunch of web pages looking for stuff. I'm more likely to ask a question\nfrom a few AI engines, kind of see, get me in the right direction. Then I'll go bumble through a few things. At work, I can tell you code\ndevelopment right now, um, we are seeing massive improvements in code\ndevelopment and support products. We have like watson code assistant. That is really showing immediate\nreturn for our code developers. And I think that'll, that will again, be a\ntool that increases productivity for code developers immediately across the globe. Yeah, um, last question. What's the one skill that every\ntechnology leader needs that has nothing to do with technology? Being able to inspire a set\nof people toward a common goal and collaborate to achieve it. That's at the core of everything. Everything. That's a lovely way to end. Thank you so much, Ric. Thank you."
