I’m Malcolm Gladwell.\nThis season, we’re continuing our conversations   with New Creators— visionaries who are creatively \napplying technology in business to drive change,   but with a focus on the transformative power \nof artificial intelligence and what it means   to leverage AI as a game-changing \nmultiplier for your business.  Today’s episode highlights the power \nof collaboration. IBM has long been a   supporter of the “better together” mindset \nand embraces partnerships. They have been   working together with Salesforce for more than \ntwo decades, but have recently launched a new   collaborative effort surrounding generative AI.\nPushkin’s very own Jacob Goldstein sat down   with Matt Candy and Susan Emerson. Matt is the \nglobal managing partner of generative AI at IBM   Consulting, helping clients and partners around \nthe world embrace this new era of technology.   And Susan is a Senior Vice president for \nSalesforce dedicated to AI, analytics and data.  They discussed the historic collaboration \nbetween the two tech giants, explored the   opportunity AI presents for customer service, \nand walked through how businesses can use   generative AI to interface with clients.\nOkay, let’s get to the conversation.  Jacob: Thank you, guys, for coming this \nmorning. So I'm interested in how you both   came to generative AI—or maybe it sort of came \nto you in the way it sort of came to all of us.  But how did you arrive at \nworking on generative AI?  Susan: As part of my remit at Salesforce over \nthe years, I've brought a lot of analytics and   data and machine-learning products to life \nunder the Einstein brand at Salesforce. So   as we pivoted Salesforce into taking \nadvantage of the generative-AI moment,   it was natural that I became part of the advance \nteam leveraging generative AI. And it's—it's   become interesting. What I see as I speak with \ncustomers—the moment that everyone is facing   in terms of how they incorporate generative AI \ninto their businesses, their workforces and their   technical stacks—it's actually opening up a lot \nof doors to the utility of analytics, data and AI.  So it's been this big pull-through in terms \nof incorporating not just generative AI,   but a larger conversation around how we \nbecome all better using data in our day jobs.  Jacob: So that's a great frame for sort of what's \ngoing on at Salesforce with generative AI. Matt,   tell us a little bit about, you know, how that \nfits with the way IBM is approaching the space.  Matt: So I guess—probably three sides to that \nquestion. And so there's the technology side to   it. So IBM has a technology organization. And \nso, you know, we are building, and have been   over many years—decades, in fact—IBM has been \nworking in this space, a generative-AI stack,   that allows organizations to adopt generative-AI \ntechnology, uh, aimed at enterprise and   business use within their organizations.\nSo then within the consulting business,   you know, we have 160,000 people who work every \nday with clients across every industry—regulated   industries, government organizations. And so this, \nyou know, is a really important technology that   those companies are going to be using to drive the \nnext level of transformation in their enterprises’   processes, and the types of experiences they \nbuild for their customers. And so, you know,   we work extensively with partners—uh, \ntechnology such as Salesforce, AWS,   Microsoft, as well as our own technology.\nAnd then finally, I guess, the third angle   is the work that we've got to do to reinvent the \nbusiness of consulting. And so if I think about,   you know, consulting and systems\nintegration, you know, ultimately   we are knowledge workers, right? And so \nfrom an industry perspective, I think,   you know, our industry is—same as many others—is \ngonna, is gonna go—undergo a level of disruption   caused by this technology, but therefore \nthat will also create a huge opportunity   for us as well. So those three aspects, Jacob. Jacob: Great. So, so that's the point of view sort of from your companies in your work. I'm curious to talk for a moment about AI from the point of   view of consumers and employees kind of out in \nthe world today. So just to start with consumers:   when I'm just out as a person, as a consumer \nin the world, how am I experiencing AI today?  Matt: I'll give you a great little use case, \nactually. I was on holiday, uh, three weeks ago,   in Tenerife in Spain. And, uh, I was trying to \nfind somewhere to park the car with the family   for dinner that evening. And, uh, I found, \nI found this area, next to this, uh, kind of   shopping center. And there was this sign there.\nAnd, uh, I couldn't quite work out if it was   saying I could park there or not. And so I took a \nphoto of the sign and I uploaded it to an AI tool,   and I said, “What does this mean?” And it \nbasically explained to me what the sign   was saying, and basically told me that \nI shouldn't be parking there. And so I   drove on and I found some—somewhere else to park.\nBut yeah, that, that allowed me, in under sixty   seconds to probably avoid a hundred- euro fine by \nparking the car there. So—just a simple example,   but I think the ability that these tools have to \ntake friction out of our daily lives, you know,   and to be able to make, just, things that we do in \nour everyday life simple and more frictionless—um,   you know, that's how I look at, how “Matt \nthe consumer” is going to benefit from   some of this type of technology. Susan: And from my perspective, it's also a travel story. I spend a lot of time on \nthe road for, for work, but recently had to send   my sister and her family to a destination they'd \nnever been to for a wedding. And, it was really   quick and easy to use some generative tools to \ncome up with a whole plan for them, because they   love to hike and to be outdoors and to hike in \nareas that aren't overly crowded with, um, people.  And so gen AI very quickly gave me an itinerary \nof a bunch of terrific hikes for them, uh,   for a destination. So, things like that. Jacob: Great, and then what about the, the effect of AI and of automation more generally on, on employees, on the workforce?  Susan: Well, there's so many dimensions to take \nthat from. Generative AI really can up-level a   workforce in all sorts of ways by providing these \nconsistent ways to engage with technology with   these natural-language experiences. So I think \nit changes everything from—it finds us content,   it generates us content, it makes it easier to \nwork with our systems of engagement and operation.  And for many organizations, uh, it's, \nuh, it can be a, a lifting factor in   terms of bringing a more consistent workforce \nexperience, because these tools can just be   ever present in our systems of, of work. Matt: I'll give you a little example. Here in IBM, we have something called Ask HR. And so that's our conversational AI interface   that we use to interact with HR services. And \n94 percent of every employee interaction now   happens without human intervention, through that \ninterface. But you would never know that. And so   if I think about, you know, our HR processes, you \nknow, we have this amazing conversational- based,   uh, AI that we use for all of our HR \ninteractions, and we surface that through   Slack. And so Slack becomes the front door for \nhow we access, a lot of these different enterprise   processes and capabilities and how we surface AI.\nIn fact, I'm taking a flight shortly back to the   UK and our Ask HR boss is reminding me that it's \nraining in the UK and I should take an umbrella.  Susan: Isn’t it always, like, raining in England?\nMatt: Yeah, I don't think there's any AI needed   for that. I think that's just a hard-coded\n“If England, then take umbrella.” That's right.  Susan: That’s just a rule. \nThat's just a rule, right?  Matt: Right, and you're able to converse, and, you \nknow, “I need to book a holiday.” “I need to move   somebody between managers.” “I need to figure \nout the policy on this.” And the AI basically   navigates across the different systems to \nbe able to help get that information—to   summarize it back, to be able to carry out the \ntransactions that I need to be carried out.  And it just, just removes all of that complexity \nand makes it easier to get things done.  Jacob: Uh, when you are working with \ncompanies to implement generative AI now,   what do you find tends to be their primary focus?\nSusan: I mean, I speak with a lot of customers   each week, and for the last several months, \nmost organizations have just been reorienting   themselves in terms of “Where are we in this \nmoment? What is this technology capable of?   What are the risks and governance and frameworks \nthat I need to establish in order to engage and   talk to everyone—talk to my vendors, talk to \nmy cloud providers, talk to my consultants,   talk to academics, and generally get your sea legs \nunder them?” And the—sort of the unstructured,   hands-on-keyboards fiddling which technology seems \nto be moving towards. “Let's get some points on   the board. Let's turn this stuff on and go.” So \nthat's what I've been seeing in terms of, uh, you   know, the work within the Salesforce ecosystem. \nMatt, you've got a larger aperture as well.  Uh, what, uh, what are you seeing? Matt: Yeah, so I, I—I definitely agree. I think, you know, there's been lots of getting sea legs, experimentation, just trying to build knowledge,   being able to try and build almost a, uh, \nyou know, internal organizational point   of view and reference framework. You know, \nI've seen lots of what I would refer to as   “random acts of AI,” you know, in, in, in \nterms of, uh, in terms of experimentation,   but I think, I think people—now looking into 2024 \nand—this is all about, now, adoption and scaling.  What's become really clear is organizations \nhave started to realize: this is going to be   a very multimodal world that they're \ngoing to live in. There is no one AI   that is the answer for their organization.\nAnd so there's—they're going to have lots of   different generative-AI models and technologies \nthat are going to sit in the organization,   servicing different use cases, different \ndomain areas, different products and   services. And so therefore having to figure \nout how they're going to navigate and manage   this kind of open world that they're going \nto be sitting in, and the decisions that   they're going to have to make around that.\nI think the second thing that I've seen,—that   people are now becoming very clear that \nthis needs to be what I would refer to as   “use-case led and outcome focused.” and so\nreally needing to start with thinking about   the business outcome and the problem \nthat, you know, we're trying to solve,   and therefore “How do I use generative AI as \npart of the mechanism to solve that problem?”  And I think, you know, what, what Susan and the \nSalesforce team do is an amazing example of that.   You know, they've got this incredible platform \nand engine that allows, you know, companies to   transform their sales and service processes and \nto be able to put data in the hands of users,   to be able to make better decisions, et cetera.\nAnd so now by weaving generative AI into that   platform, we're going to be able to make those \nprocesses and workflows even more efficient,   right? So it's generative AI plus all of these \nother amazing things that are there, but it will   be led through business outcomes and it will \nbe led through the use case and the business   problem or workflow that we're trying to improve.\nAnd then I think the third thing is shifting from   this experimentation to scale. You know—I think \neverybody's really early in this journey, but   what's become clear is that, you know, everybody \nnow needs—realizes and is starting to lay down   these, these ground rules, the guardrails, the \nframeworks to allow them to scale this across   the organization. So, you know, I think, I think \nwe're in for an exciting, exciting time in 2024.  Jacob: So now that we're getting to this \nmoment, what are the key things companies have   to figure out about scaling generative AI? Susan: I would put that in , kind of two categories. And following what—on what Matt was saying in terms of use-case defined and outcome   led—100 percent on that in terms of starting \nwith a hypothesis of value while at the same   time people are getting, uh, you know, closer to \nthe technology, to know what their bounds are.   But the biggest, you know, set of conversations \nis in the enterprise area in terms of embarking   and using with generative AI—how to do it in \nways, that is safe for—uh, use of data that   is safe around, not just, the larger topic \nof generative AI and hallucinations, which,   which are fun to talk about in the media, but— Jacob: It’s a fun word, right? If it was called something other than “hallucinations,” people wouldn't   talk about it as much. It was just mistakes. Susan: Yeah, that's right—just things that aren't factually true. We’ve been doing a lot \nof work at Salesforce around using, you know,   dynamic and structured—grounding the data so \nwe can give very strong and not naive prompt   instructions to LLMs to get return on that.\nSo, so just to summarize, uh: top of mind for   organizations using, you know, large language \nmodels is using their data in ways that are   safe. Trusted. Not exposed. And reducing \nthe opportunity for hallucinations and   maximizing relevant content. Jacob: Great. So, so Matt, Susan was talking about, you know, both what organizations are, are concerned with as they   scale generative AI and how Salesforce is \nworking to sort of address those concerns.  What are you seeing at IBM? Matt: Yeah, so I think—certainly from a, from a “scaling of generative AI” perspective, \nthis topic of governance, and how organizations   are going to have to govern all of these models \nthat sit, sit with—inside, how they manage,   kind of, bias, fairness, model drift.\nYou know, if you think about the data   that's gone into a model and the output it gives \nto start with—not because the model changes,   but because the context of the world \nmoves on. And so being able to kind of   manage this model drift is going to be a really \nimportant thing. I think data really matters.  And so quality, access, security, uh, around data \nwithin the enterprise is going to be critical to   scaling generative AI. And the other one I think \nthat's going to be really important, and I think   many organizations haven't even got there yet in \ntheir thinking, is around the ESG implications.   So: carbon. You know, the use of this technology \ndoes not come without a cost of carbon.  Jacob: Carbon meaning it's very energy intensive. Matt: Correct. Yeah. The training of the models. And so thinking about carbon disclosures and thinking about where I'm infusing it into my   business and how much I'm using it and what the \ncarbon cost of that is. As I think about the—you   know, my own organizational responsibilities to \nreduce carbon, I think, you know, there's all of   these things that I think are going to become \nimportant factors as people are thinking about   the scaling implications of this technology. Malcolm Gladwell: AI is already making new experiences possible, but we must be mindful in how we integrate this new technology as we   continue scaling generative AI. Matt touched upon \nsome crucial aspects from an IBM perspective:   governance, bias, fairness, and security are \nall key considerations when organizations   aim to expand their use of generative AI. The \nenvironmental aspect is especially important,   and it’s refreshing to hear leading thinkers like \nMatt and Susan highlight these issues. As this   technology continues to evolve, these factors are \nbecoming increasingly important for organizations   to address. The historic collaboration between \nIBM and Salesforce is helping to remedy issues   companies face when scaling AI. Jacob: So IBM and Salesforce recently announced a new collaborative project   around generative AI. Tell me more about that. Matt: We've been partners for over two decades now, IBM and Salesforce. And so within our consulting business, we work with Salesforce   technology to help our clients implement that \ntechnology to transform their businesses.  We've got a huge practice—over 12,000 people with \ncertifications—around Salesforce platforms. And   so, you know, with Susan and her team \nand the broader team in Salesforce,   we're infusing more capability into the platform \naround generative AI. Then our mission is really   simple. It's to help clients who are using the \nSalesforce platform adopt those capabilities   to help them get more benefit within their \norganization. You know, we’re also a significant   user of Salesforce technology within IBM.\nWe're one of Salesforce's largest customers   globally. And so, you know, as we continue to \ntransform our own sales and service processes   within IBM, then our use of the generative-AI \ncapabilities that they're infusing into Sales   Cloud, Service Cloud, Slack, et cetera will be \nsomething that will become really important to   us driving productivity within the company.\nAnd then the other thing that I would say is,   you know—as I think about the work \nthat we do with clients, you know,   as they're implementing and on their generative-AI \njourneys, you know—they're going to utilize and   leverage the Salesforce capabilities within the \nplatform, and their generative-AI technologies.  But then you start thinking about processes \nand workflows that run beyond the walls of CRM,   right? That run into supply chain and into \nthe finance area of the organization. And   so there is work that we're doing with clients \nwhere we're using IBM's watsonx platform to be   able to help get access to—to generate insights \nfrom data sources that sit in all of these kind   of back-office areas of the enterprise, and to be \nable to get that data across the Salesforce into   these customer-interaction points and into the \nemployees who are servicing those customers, using   Salesforce's AI and generative-AI technology. So \nthere's a kind of “one plus one equals three” kind   of, you know, “better together,” and being—being \nable to bring our technologies together in service   of these clients’, problems as you think about \nthese processes that run across their enterprise.  So, so, yeah, so, so huge, huge \nopportunity in what we're doing   together in the market to help clients. Susan: Yeah, and just building on that, uh, it is a huge moment for, for organizations and for technology companies like Salesforce.   And we couldn't be happier to have partnerships \nlike we have with IBM. Like, the range of thought   leadership that is appropriate at the moment \nis everything from “What is that hypothesis   of value?” and “What are those use cases?” \nand “What is the order of operation in terms   of approaching it just in terms of focus?”\nBut then things that would help organizations   assess their AI readiness and then their \napproach. Like, you know, we talked earlier   about frameworks and guardrails. Uh, you know, \n“What are use cases that we're comfortable with,   given the state of the technology, that face \nemployees or face customers?” So creating   these much larger roadmaps in terms of how to \napproach this over a series of initiatives.  The way it can fundamentally change the way we \nengage with technology and what that means for   the, you know, training and change management and \nuse cases that fundamentally shift how you engage   with systems like Salesforce. There's just a massive opportunity for us together. Jacob: So you're talking in sort of general terms. I'm interested in, you know, \nthinking in particular about the way generative   AI can essentially lead to better business \noutcomes, right? Like, what does that look like?   How do you measure it? You know, there's a certain \nbottom-line question there, right? Like, how does   AI make businesses work better, and in what ways? Susan: You know, as consumers of products and services, we, we all love and respect great service, you know, in terms of getting timely,   quick answers, resolving issues \nquickly—all those, those types of things.  And from the perspective of, of using generative \nand predictive capabilities for agents who are   interacting with customers, there is just a whole \nton of opportunity to take friction out of the   process in terms of finding answers, resolving \nissues, in terms of using these generative   capabilities that will bring, you know, answers \nand content to the fingertips more easily to the   human agents that are working with customers.\nNow, taking that to the next step for   organizations, uh, when they're ready to \nmove into more customer-facing automation,   that's yet another channel, as a consumer, we'll \nall enjoy with the brands and the products and   the services that we want in terms of fast answers \nand resolutions to customers. And as we all know,   great customer experience yields return business.\nNow on the sales side, you know, maybe a different   example—and these are areas where I think the \ncapability of predictive and generative go very   well together in terms of focusing on business \noutcomes. And a classic example would be,   you know, predictions that help us understand \ncustomer health. You know, “Is this customer   engaged?” “Is this customer at risk?” Predictions \nthat help us understand the next best product or   next best conversation—these all help focus a \nsales team's time on a customer or a territory,   and so that deep focus “puts all the wood \nbehind an arrow,” so to speak, in terms of   where we should be engaging. And those types \nof driven sales organizations that have these   capabilities just lead to better performance \nand outcomes and customer experience, too.  Now, let's also layer in generative capabilities, \nuh, where we're using the generative capabilities   to assist and augment a sales team, where \nwe're using the power of generative for   everything like generating, uh, personalized \nand relevant customer- interaction content.  For example, leveraging our customer data—like \nengagement history, product purchases,   service history—to create an email or a campaign. \nAnd, uh, the scale of automation has just never   been possible before. And, you know, maybe even \ntaking this one step further with generative,   where we take all the administrative friction out \nof the day job and doing things for sales teams,   like summarizing their calls or \ncreating a meeting plan for them.  And, you know, very broadly speaking, using \ngenerative AI to change the interaction   mode with systems like Salesforce \nfrom clicks and, and training, uh,   where people have to focus on the process, \nto more-conversational user experiences,   which are much more engaging and easier to use. \nSo all of this together is just incredible and   transformational, uh, and makes, uh, \nall businesses and people work better.  Jacob: I just want to spend one more moment \non the partnership between IBM and Salesforce   and generative AI. And there's this phrase that's \ninteresting to me. It's “ecosystem partnership.”   That, I think, is relevant here. So what is an \n“ecosystem partnership” and why is it, you know,   helpful in, in creating scalable AI solutions? Matt: This idea of being open, I think is probably one of the most important premises for us as technology companies, for us as consultancies   and system integrators. And for our clients to \nthink about the, the sources of value that can   be created through taking an open approach is \nhugely important. So if I think about—for us,   “ecosystem” means making sure that we have \nall of the different partnerships that we   need with technology providers, with service \nproviders—that we can bring to our clients the   right set of capabilities to solve the problem \nthat they've got, and not thinking that just,   you know, what we have in house or what we have \nwith just one other partner that we work with,   you know, is, is, is the right thing.\nAnd so, you know, I think every problem   that our clients have is solved through a \nrange of technologies that come together in   service of creating that business outcome. Jacob: I want to touch briefly on ethics and governance. Something like 80 percent of CEOs see explainability, ethics, bias,   trust as major concerns on the road to \nAI adoption. And so I'm, I'm curious how   business leaders navigate these things, and in \nparticular how Salesforce and IBM are building   these concerns into how they work with customers. Susan: You know, we've been incorporating predictive machine learning into our, our products since mid–last decade, and at that time we started   with all of our ethics and governance, work at \nthat time in terms of frameworks for engaging with   AI in ethical and safe ways, and have a lot of \nguidance for customers in terms of those programs.  The machine-learning, focus that we've had \nat Salesforce has always been deeply focused   on explainability. So if we're making, \nyou know, predictive recommendations   to explain how we got to that, you know, \nwhether—that's something that a user sees as  they're engaging with it, so they have full \ntrust, uh, in terms of interacting with it, but   also for the practitioners who are building it.\nSo we have this, like, long-standing vibe and   capability with our predictive, side of the house, \nand on the generative side of the house, you know,   the state of the marketplace right now is—LLMs \nfor most people are, are largely black boxes,   uh, in terms of not fully interpretable in \nterms of how they come up with their content.  Now, that said, there is a lot that you \ncan do in terms of audit, in terms of,   you know, transparency, in terms of “What are \nthe prompts that are being submitted to these   LLMs?” “What do these LLMs provide back in \nterms of return?” And then “What did the   human do to change it, use it, or adjust it?”\nSo we've been updating all of our ethics and,   and governance frameworks now, I guess I would \ncall it, with safety components as well in terms   of how to work with data, in safe ways and \nwith these transparent governance models.  Matt: Yeah. So, I mean, this is an area that IBM \nhas been kind of working on for many years. And   so, you know, our AI ethics board that we have \ninternally kind of governs and, and provides   frameworks and guidance for everything that we do \nin the company. There's a lot of work that we do   to help our clients and organizations establish \ntheir strategies for AI governance, as well as   their own internal policies, models, approaches, \nethics boards, et cetera. And so, you know,   helping them put in place these ground rules and \nguardrails, organizational process, uh, changes,   et cetera, I think is a really important part \nof this scaling discussion that we were having   earlier as, as, as people are going to be kind of \nrolling out more of this technology internally.  And then I think there's, a lot that organizations \nare going to have to do to think about— especially   in the generative world—around all of the \ndifferent types of models that they're using,   models that they're training and tuning \nand building, and how they manage all of   those for explainability and bias drift \nand, actually, regulatory requirements.  Like if you—if you think about what's, what's \nhappening around the world as different   countries—uh, the EU AI Act—you know, there's \nlots of different regulatory requirements that are   going to be coming in. And so for multinational \ncompanies operating across multiple countries,   how they're going to be—have to make sure that \nthey're, they're complying with all of not only   their own internal policies, but the\nrequirements of the country,   as well as, potentially, industry \nregulatory requirements as well.  And so there's a lot that we are doing and going \nto be doing in, helping them manage complexity.   But IBM has a very firm view that we believe \nthat this is all about regulating AI risk,   not AI algorithms, and so focusing on, \nprecision regulation. So, you know,   use the, use the bodies and—regulatory bodies \nthat are out there to provide the, the control,   as opposed to trying to regulate the technology. Jacob: So generative AI is changing kind of absurdly quickly, right? A year and a half ago, we wouldn't have been having this conversation.  We're here today. Everything's happening now. \nI'm curious what you both think about— about the   near-term future of generative AI, right? If we \ncame back in a year, or let's say two years from   now, if we came back two years from now to talk \nabout the work you're doing in generative AI,   what would we be talking about? Susan: I use this example sometimes. I have three kids, and I don't think any of them \nhave ever gone into a bank to deposit a check,   right? They pull out their mobile phone and they scan the check with the camera, and they're done. Jacob: I'm surprised that they even know what a check is, for the record, but yes. Susan: Right. Well, yeah, uh, sometimes their parents give them one. Like, they get direct deposit. But anyway, like, this experience of,   like, “What do you mean I go into a branch and \ncash a check? I just do this with my mobile   phone.” And I, I think a little bit of, of it that \nway in terms of the systems that we use at work. I   can imagine explaining to my, my kids like, “Oh, \nyeah, at Salesforce, you know, back when someone   had their first day on the job, you know, as \na, as a service agent or as a salesperson,   they would have tabs on the screen and they \nwould be trained where to click and they'd have   documented processes in manuals, and it showed \nthem where to get from point A to point B.”  And as the clock turns forward, they're just \ninteracting with a natural-language prompt. But,   it just kind of fundamentally \nchanges the way we'll be able   to interact with our systems of record at work. Jacob: It’ll be just much more conversational. Instead of clicking through something, \nyou'll just basically have a conversation.  Susan: Much more conversational. Matt: Yeah, this is the biggest paradigm shift in how we interact with technology, I\nthink, since the graphical user interface.  And it's going to enable us to almost put aside \nall of that complexity within organizations   around system silos, process silos, flows, \nbecause you're just going to layer this, just,   simple, natural-language interface over all of \nthat complexity. Yeah. It's going to amplify,   I think, the potential of every person on every \nteam in a way that we've never been able to see   before. And the other thing that I think, as you \nproject forward in a couple of years—and Susan,   just picking up on the point that you \ntalked about, about banking, you know,   I think there's a wonderful little example.\nIf you think back to the ’70s and the ’80s,   when the ATM, kind of, cash machines \nwere rolling out—and at that time it   wasn't really a reaction that was one \nof awe or appreciation for convenience,   but people were concerned that we were \nautomating away the bank-teller jobs,   right? But now when you think about it, what \nactually happened was, this technology allowed   the banks to scale their branch networks, more \nbranches than ever before, more bank tellers than   ever before. Bank-teller employment and salaries \nincreased, even though we automated a lot of work,   because when they weren't having to spend \ntheir time counting cash out for people,   they were able to do more-valuable things, right?\nAnd new types of financial products and services   and mortgages. And so if I think back to that, \nin the ’70s and ’80s, and then I project to   where we are today, we're just going to \nunleash this creativity and potential for   employees and enterprises by freeing up the \ntime that they're spending on things that,   you know—they can do far more value-added tasks.\nAnd so I think—we're going to be amazed, I think,   around what, what happens and what companies and \npeople are going to be able to do as we give them   the time and space to be able to do that. Jacob: Great. So just to close, I want to talk about how both of you use creativity in your own work. Just to start with you, Matt: I know that you love to combine creativity \nand technology through design. Do you use   generative AI in your own creative process? Matt: Yeah, so I, I, I'm a firm believer that this combination of experience and AI is going to be the thing that makes a difference. Like,   these large language models and this technology \nhas been around actually for a number of years.   And it's only at the point, late 2022, \nwhere open AI wrapped a digital experience   around this and put it in the hands of \npeople, that suddenly the transformative   power of this technology was realized.\nAnd so I think the way that we surface   these capabilities and put them in the hands \nof people, to be able to adopt it in a really   frictionless way, is, is the thing that's going to \nbe, hugely important to the adoption and scaling   of this. So I, I think the most important \nthing for companies to do is to make people,   not technology, central to their strategy. Jacob: Just to go more broadly into your work, Susan—I mean, I know that you have, have launched Salesforce's AI products into   the market and that, you know, a lot \nof those have been built—obviously,   given Salesforce’s business—around helping \npeople build stronger customer relationships.  Right? And so I'm curious: what \ncreativity did you bring to that work?  Susan: Some of the products that I work with \nat Salesforce—they're, they're deeply visually   focused. And my personal perspective is, \nis that the world can be really noisy. Uh,   we're just inundated with all sorts of demands \non our time through so many channels, right?   Like the phone is firing off, you're getting \ninstant messages, you're getting Slack messages,   you're getting, you know, DMS, you're \ngetting emails, your phone is ringing,   there's processes that are bearing down on you.\nAnd if we can use really good design to filter   out and essentially weed the garden— because, you \nknow, we have this, this phrase at Salesforce,   is “Everything—if everything's important, \nnothing's important.” So using really good design   to create the user experience in Salesforce just \nbrings stuff to life in the most powerful way.  So I always think of it from that perspective. \nLike if I'm going to put this on a screen, and,   and, and Salesforce—what did I not put on? \nIs this the most important thing? And is this   the thing that's going to align everyone to the \nlarger initiative of the firm? So, so it's that   kind of design thinking that I use probably every \nmoment of the day, whether I'm building a demo or   talking to an executive at a company in terms \nof—as I see a vision for how they might deploy   our products, to actual product development. Jacob: And then just to kind of bring together these two themes we've been talking about: on the one hand, this sort of—ecosystem partnerships,   and on the other hand, creativity.\nI mean, can you talk a little bit   about how working with, working with partners \ncan foster a different kind of creativity?  Susan: More perspectives are always \nbetter than few perspectives.  Matt: I completely agree.\nI think the more minds, the   more perspectives, the more experiences, I think \nabout some of the best sessions, best workshops,   best work we do with clients—it's when you've \ngot people not just from one industry but from   many industries, because actually the adjacencies \nand the things that are happening in these other   spaces trigger new thoughts and new ideas. And \nso, you know, I think the richness that we get   when we partner with Salesforce together around \nhelping clients transform their front office,   their sales, service, marketing processes, \nwe all bring these unique experiences.  And I think that just opens \nthe aperture to better, better   outcomes and better perspectives for our clients. Susan: Well, you know, you've been asking these questions about, like the use of, of tech and AI and creativity all sort of in the same sentence.  And one of the things that I also think of \nis—in terms of remaining deeply creative—is   the actual process of unplugging for all—from \nall that stuff. So taking a trial run with no   earphones in your head for me is always a really \ngood way of unleashing and unbridling a lot of,   you know, creative spirit.\nJust that, that downtime and   the unstructured time where your brain can \njust run free, actually, not assisted by any   kind of device in my head or in my face. So— Jacob: I think, with that praise of unplugged time, we should say goodbye and let's unplug. It was lovely to talk with you guys. It was   really interesting to learn about your work \nand the relationship between the companies.  So thank you for your time. Matt: Thank you, Jacob. Thank you. Malcolm Gladwell: A huge thanks is due to  Jacob, Matt and Susan for illuminating the possibilities of generative AI. This technology has great promise for creating new experiences in the future but requires the scaling capabilities made possible   by partnerships like IBM and Salesforce.\nAs our conversation with Susan and Matt   illustrated, we’re at an exciting phase \nof adoption. Most companies have moved   beyond experimentation and are now prioritizing \nscaling. The key areas of focus for organizations   now include managing multiple AI models, as \nwell as thinking about specific use cases   and desired outcomes. However, this scale is \ndifficult for companies to do on their own.  To unlock the real potential of generative AI \nin transforming experiences, they’ll require   the scaling capabilities made possible \nby partnerships like IBM and Salesforce.  This conversation showed the promise of \nteamwork. When massive companies combine   their brainpower to push forward technology, \ntheir collaborative efforts have the potential   to revolutionize industries.\nOne quick programming note:   we will be taking a little time off, and will be \nreturning in just a few weeks with a new episode.  Smart Talks with IBM is produced by Matt \nRomano, Joey Fischground, David Zha, and   Jacob Goldstein.
