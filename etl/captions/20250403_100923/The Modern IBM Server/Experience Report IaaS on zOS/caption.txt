so last time Rosen and I talked to you guys we talked about what it's like to be a new main framer in this world starting new career any fears excitements all that good stuff we talked a little bit about any myths and kind of lore and about Z and Mainframe but we want to take a little bit more closer look at that let's talk about the traditional way to get some context first rosand yeah so in my world or the traditional world to build infrastructure we have JCL we have to modify get changes to do kicks regions we have JCL to do it db2 yes again more JCL let's go a little bit more in this example the JCL isn't one JCL it's a bunch of JCL my configuration my rack F all of the I have to do it right for every single piece so yes modifying JCL submitting modifying JCL 3 hours everything's perfect one week yeah that's more normal not the best way that worked for a little bit it looked for worked for some time rosn talked about JCL running jobs and all of this other stuff using tools that I didn't really understand when I first got here so I didn't worry about that instead I used modern tooling that I learned in college and still absolutely worked with c and my work use tools like vs code writing yaml files and most importantly python python was huge when I when I first started out here and still is today so let's take a closer look at what what I actually did what my team and I did start with the yaml because yaml is where it all started this yaml has all the configurations we need for to install and customize our db2 any changes we need to make any updates we want to make to our system or something our product owner asks us to do it's easy to make that change you just go in here make the change run it through our Python scripts and our db2 is up and running again let's take a look at these Python scripts because that's pretty important and again all this stuff was in VVS code something I learned in college everyone's easy to use so python we have a series of scripts written in Python that go through each of the installation steps that are needed to install this db2 and customize it to what we want it to be uh and it say eventually it will become this fully automated process where any anyone who uses our product can send their yaml in run through the steps pops out the db2 this fully automated process was easy it's easy to understand it's efficient I can do it I I did this it was exciting experience and not something that I needed to do any kind of special training on and any new person coming into the main frame can do something exactly like this so I hope that this talk kind of spelled any rumors or scary ideas you had about being a new person coming into the zor I graduated college less than a year ago all the tools that I used in college the automation I used all still applied here in the real world in Mainframe and how about the rest of us we can use this too and take advantage of all this great technology modern tools modern automation thanks for watching before you leave please remember to hit like And subscribe
