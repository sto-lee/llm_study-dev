standing here outside this admittedly generic and boring looking building in Austin Texas but inside IBM develops and tests power servers now the lab is usually off limits to everyone except the core team but I got us a special invite to check it out Follow Me [Music] Wait thank you so much for having us today I'm excited for you to show me around this data center it's not a data center okay what is it it's a system integration and test Development Center for our Power Systems okay what does that mean this is where we put all the systems together for the first time put the power supply as the back planes the chassis memory processors all together we're the first ones to turn it on we do what we call a system power on and then check for smoke and by check for smoke you mean make sure that nothing's broken correct we run Soup To Nuts all the testing you can possibly do to make sure that the customers are getting the Boost reliable server that they can possibly get I love that I'd love to see what you got can you show me let's go so as you can see there's a noise warning for this lab inside right now about 65 decibels it's about to get a lot louder although I can barely hear him over the sound of hundreds of Enterprise grade systems buzzing away whoa whoa from here Wayne explained that this is one of the labs where the reliability and availability of power servers are tested that includes checking both firmware and software Integrations in essence IBM scientists and Engineers run these power servers non-stop at their limit to monitor for performance dips this rigor helps them build machines that businesses can rely on for their most important work even when they encounter extreme conditions and that takes us to our next stop where are we now with these things this is called the guard band this is where they do the external testing on the system we'll run it through extreme heat extreme cold voltage high voltage low voltage and make sure that it'll always continue running so our reliability is what a customer expects okay it's basically a torture chamber for servers yeah you could call it that like one of these things here yeah in fact that's one of our small ones this this is the small I've got a bigger one back here this thing here yeah it's massive right now we're doing a cold testing on the power uh e 1080. cool check it out there's a freezing in here yeah how cold is it uh right now it's 10 degrees C it's probably going to go a little bit colder than this okay but the servers have to run at cold temperatures so you basically leave it in here turn on the ice and get it as close as possible to make sure that they can run actually they like it colder like this okay but uh they need to run when it gets really cold and in the same chamber can you also turn up the heat so you test your heat we're going to go probably up to 85 degrees in here wow so what other type of testing are you putting these Services we also do earthquake testing for systems like we go to California where they might be sub to an earthquake we also do RF testing where we subject the system to RF signals and also try to see what kind of our signals come out then there's a noise testing too how much noise is actually coming out or put out by the system versus how much noise it could take it sounds like you got to consider a ton of things when you're like designing an architecture oh yeah is there someone I could talk to about that well kava is a main engineer so he'd be a good one to talk to I'd love to meet comics all right coffee so this is the E 1080 server right yes that's correct so this has four power 10 processors but e1080 comes with multiple flavors customers could order it up to a 16 socket system which means four of these stacked on top of each other for these big boys and then cable up together from the back gotcha let's take a look inside before we do that let's let's put our status oh okay and what are these for these are to make sure we discharge our body to the system so we don't harm any Electronics cool I don't want to break anything so I'll do that sat here okay we got our four processors here so these four things are processors no no no this is this is a heatsink this is what cools the processor okay underneath the heat sinks we actually have four of these this is the actual power 10 e 1080 processor okay so this is like the brains of the server this is the brain of the system yes and what's special about this power 10 processor here actually inside what you're holding is actually a power 10 chip okay we're getting smaller and smaller here right so so this is based on a seven nanometer technology and there are 18 billion devices into what you're holding right 18 million or billion 18 billion 18 billion devices on this chip correct that's amazing so what are some of the unique properties of the chip so we have a built-in AI inferencing inside a chip and it's about 5x faster than what our previous generation power 9 processors have not bad and what does AI inferencing do for the user it's used for machine learning okay and in other systems uh for machine learning use gpus and fpgas you have to transfer data from your processor to somewhere else get it processed and move back and our processor everything is done and the processor itself so they don't have to move the data as far so it's faster and it's more reliable correct and also a lot more secure because you're not moving the data somewhere else to get processed and come back these are actually cables to bring the signal from top of our processors bring the high speed signals out via these cables to the back of the system and that's how we are connecting four of these systems to each other so when they're stacked on top of each other comes out through this snake node comes directly from top of a processor which we are the only one in the industry is doing that wow goes through these copper cables internal cables go through an external cable like this through the back go to another node that that's how we managed to connect four of these together to create one gigantic 16 socket system another really important part our memory our memory subsystem we have a buffer chip in our memory okay and every single communication between the processor and the memory is fully encrypted through the hardware also as a spare dram as well so if there's any any of these drams that you can see if there's any of them fail it will actually can switch the spare and keep going without losing any performance without the system coming down and because this system it's all about reliability and availability we have an extra power phase for on all the dims very cool and this system fully loaded can have up to 64 terabyte of memory 64 terabytes that's a lot that's a lot and because of that and because of the performance the system provides we actually hold the world record for sap Hana the largest sap Hana database that's certified it's run on this system wow in front of the memory we have all the Regulators these are vrms or what we call voltage Regulators every different component in the system use different voltages okay so The Regulators like this brings the 12 volts down that our power supply generates to different voltage levels that other components need because this is our most reliable system every single Regulators they're n plus two phase that means there are two extra phase wow just sitting there as a backup just in case anything goes wrong system automatically switches to the backup and keep going and there are other components here in the front as well for example this is our clock card this card generates reference clock for the processor and the memory for different components in the system and if you notice there are two of them identical and the reason for that is again this is our most reliable system for every single component there is a redundant one a backup that's fair so there's a lot of stuff going on in here and I think it gets pretty hot I know we got the heatsink but we also have fans up front correct in the front of a system we have five fans assemblies these are all concurrently maintainable what that means is while the system is up and running if there's any issue with any of the fans we can service them without the system going down the wall system is up and running so everything you and Wayne have showed me today means this machine is super powerful it's super reliable yes that's correct you can do a lot of work with a lot less of these machines so because of that you can have a lot smaller carbon Footprints things that you could do potentially with 100 servers you could do probably with two of these so you're lowering your carbon footprint and probably saving doing some cost savings as well of course you you save costs by less less power getting used and also for licensing typically licensed things they get charged by how much core how many core you have and because this machine can do a lot more with a lot less system a lot less cores you save a lot of money from licensing fees as well so what's next for you guys what are you working on now so so we're already working on next generation of these systems so no rest no downtime you're already doing the Next Generation and you're going to look to beat the records you set with this one of course [Music]
