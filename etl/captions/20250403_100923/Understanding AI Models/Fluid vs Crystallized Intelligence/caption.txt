pop quiz time let's test your intelligence so what is the capital of france why paris may we okay now complete the sequence a1 b2 c did you say three yeah that's pretty easy but that wasn't the real quiz here's what i really want to know which form of thinking did you use to solve each question well recalling previously acquired information like a capital city is a form of intelligence known as crystallized intelligence whereas the use of reasoning and logic to deduce the next character in a sequence that is known as fluid intelligence my name is martin keane and i'm a master inventor at ibm so crystallized intelligence refers to knowledge that comes from previously acquired information it's dependent on a person's knowledge on their skills on their expertise developed over a lifetime of learning and experience crystallized intelligence is fact and experience based whereas fluid intelligence is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in new and unfamiliar situations independent of acquired knowledge fluid intelligence represents a person's ability to problem-solve using reasoning and by also using logic when you come across a new problem that your current knowledge can't address you call on fluid intelligence to resolve it now the notion of fluid and crystallized intelligence dates back to 1963 when it was first formalized by psychologist raymond cattell now you might be asking yourself why am i talking about psychology in an ibm technology video well because these two forms of intelligence that we use to solve problems every day can also play an important role in machine learning so for example consider an ai system like ibm watson to answer a question it can sift through like a million books per second and perhaps the answer to a question is right there in one of those books like our paris example in that case it's a simple case of natural language understanding to answer the question what is the capital of france that's crystallized intelligence but most problems aren't that simple and to solve them we may need to combine both crystallized and fluid intelligence together so for example say we wanted an a i travel system let's build one an ai travel system and what we want it to do is to build us an itinerary of the best way to spend a day in paris so the output of this is an itinerary we need to use our knowledge of parisian geography and cultural history to build a corpus of what's available that's the crystallized intelligence part but we also need to apply those options to a derived understanding of the types of activities that we like to do so these are the sorts of things that we'd be interested in doing what do we normally do when we visit a new city are there comparable options here in paris can we tailor this to our personality to our budget and our willingness to try new things all of that stuff well that's the fluid intelligence side of things so from there a system could derive a subset of all the possible things to do in paris that day distilled into a tailorized personalized itinerary so for us humans our crystallized intelligence is knowledge we acquire and fluid intelligence is how we apply it for an ai system you can think of a systems model as being crystallized intelligence because it teaches itself to do one task really well by training on massive data sets of prior experience then you can think of its ability to solve new problems as being fluid intelligence because it can apply that model to a previously unseen problem and as for me my crystallized and fluid intelligence is telling me that morning croissants under the eiffel tower should be top of my list if you have any questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like and subscribe thanks for watching
