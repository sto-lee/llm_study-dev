As hundreds of millions of people around the 
globe get in their vehicles every day the absolute   last thing that anyone wants is to get in a car 
crash. Unfortunately reality strikes and there   are millions of crashes around the globe every 
day. These are stressful dangerous and extremely   costly in fact according to the association for 
safe international road travel countries can pay   up to two to eight percent of their entire GDP on 
the cost of crashes. So here's a business question   how can a modern insurance company step in 
leverage data in AI and help alleviate some of the   time and stressors that their customers are paying 
on all of these crashes. Let's say Caitlyn has   just been in an accident the last thing she wants 
to worry about is a month-long claims process with   her insurance company. Luckily her insurer has an 
automated claims processing workflow established   on their back end which means just minutes after 
she's been rear-ended she's able to provide   some basic information to get the claims process 
going. Another advantage is she's able to gather   and input the responsible parties information on 
the spot without having to track him down later   leveraging her smartphone's camera she can 
quickly document the damages and then select   the local shop she'd like the repairs done at. The 
last step is to have the insurer call her an Uber   so that she can continue about her day crashes 
are not fun although insurers today have the   ability to make the impact they have on their 
customers less stressful and they do this by   ensuring that they have complete mastery of how 
all of their data interacts with their customers.   And their customers experience with IBM 
insurers can deliver modern customer   experiences like this example through a hybrid 
cloud and AI platform deployable anywhere.   To dive deeper check out the linked videos and
