Unfortunately reality strikes and there   are millions of crashes around the globe every \nday. These are stressful dangerous and extremely   costly in fact according to the association for \nsafe international road travel countries can pay   up to two to eight percent of their entire GDP on \nthe cost of crashes. So here's a business question   how can a modern insurance company step in \nleverage data in AI and help alleviate some of the   time and stressors that their customers are paying \non all of these crashes. Let's say Caitlyn has   just been in an accident the last thing she wants \nto worry about is a month-long claims process with   her insurance company. Luckily her insurer has an \nautomated claims processing workflow established   on their back end which means just minutes after \nshe's been rear-ended she's able to provide   some basic information to get the claims process \ngoing. Another advantage is she's able to gather   and input the responsible parties information on \nthe spot without having to track him down later   leveraging her smartphone's camera she can \nquickly document the damages and then select   the local shop she'd like the repairs done at. The \nlast step is to have the insurer call her an Uber   so that she can continue about her day crashes \nare not fun although insurers today have the   ability to make the impact they have on their \ncustomers less stressful and they do this by   ensuring that they have complete mastery of how \nall of their data interacts with their customers.   And their customers experience with IBM \ninsurers can deliver modern customer   experiences like this example through a hybrid \ncloud and AI platform deployable anywhere.   To dive deeper check out the linked videos and \nensure to like and subscribe to stay up to date."
