I'd like to introduce something that that will make training a whole lot easier for you and your team and make deployments uh much easier and will have much less stress and to illustrate that I actually have a story to give some context so my team was uh on a crunch time with a project with getting a model out and so we finally got the department to approve a GPU server for us to be able to use some of these larger language models like Burt and Roberta and things like that so we got on there we started doing our work we went as fast as we could to put our notebooks on there we're getting some good results we started getting some actors some some pretty good accuracy and we continue developing until one day we try to SSH into the server and we can't so only to find out that our our department only paid for one month on the GPU server so what happened to all the notebooks all the uh data all the features that we prepared on the server completely gone and so maybe a moment of silence for all the notebooks that I lost in that but um that pretty much reflects what a lot of manual processes what a lot of manual training processes I mean uh look like right now so first of all you're usually starting out with Eda and Eda is just exploratory data analysis can we get the data that we need to make this model a success so you're looking at you know uh getting it from SQL databases or from different teams that can give you an export but somehow you're Gathering all this data once you get the data you know that the data is not ready the data has to be prepped and so you're looking at some time with data prep and working in some of the gaps and seeing if anything needs to be cleaned and from there you might move to feature engineering we might which might still be within the same process uh as at the same time you're doing your data prep and you're creating and you're transforming some of these um columns and you're turning them into new features that will help your model well once you have the features you're ready to train in and so training is usually the next step training is its own uh process it's its own pass because you have to look into different models you have to look and see which one's going to give you the best accuracy which one is most applicable to your problem is it NLP is it a regression um that type of thing and the training starts once you get some good models you also have to do the hyper parameter optimization depending on the model from there you're ready for deployment and deployment can be its own can of worms because it's either using some sort of API or it's got to integrate with a front end or back end and if you're a small team like my own you might be the people riding both the front end and the training um so you're doing all of that and then finally be ready for monitoring and looking at how this is performing it's all on the deployment server however you decided to do your endpoint and you just got to look and see if this accuracy is good enough for the business but what will happen is you know entropy eventually your model is not gonna be as accurate as it needs to be and so this process this whole process starts again or your team is tasked with a new model but all of that is manual and uh really adds a lot of headache only for only 60 to 80 percent right only 20 is 40 to 20 percent of them actually making it to production that's a lot of work and I'm here to show you a different and better way so ml Ops as you can tell from the name implements devops principles devops tools and devops practices into the machine learning workflow and so the beginning of devops in the beginning of really any development project is you're going to start out with uh the the the the dev and the Eda work all of that at the end of the day is code right you're writing a notebook you're writing some sort of python script or some R script or Julia or something like that uh but all of that is code and you can put all of that code in a source code repository and what that does is it opens us up for the automation that's going to come next so we can actually go in two directions from our Dev and Eda looking first of all um the deployment if that's an API that you're writing or a front end or something like that the deployment can have CI and CD tools applied to those commits that you're putting into your repository on the on the other side your training can also take benefit from CI and CD and I'm repeating those terms but what that means is continuous integration and continuous deployment uh which just means that every time you make a commit on your repositories automatically you can build and automatically you can you can deploy your deployment or automatically you can push a model to start being trained usually if you have uh the resources you're going to want to separate your training infrastructure from your deployment infrastructure and that's because they're doing different tasks training you're usually going to want a GPU some sort of Highly parallel computation and on deployment you might be fine with spinning up Docker containers or something uh little little containers that might have a load balancer to just uh handle demand but from there both of these can benefit from monitoring so in devops there's naturally monitoring tools just to make sure your deployments are still live just to make sure your rollouts are happening and you can also see how a b tests are doing and things like that we can apply the same ideas to your model how is your model accuracy are there things that or maybe trigger let's say you reach 80 accuracy which is which is too low what you can do from that is automatically trigger a new training process and you'll take the code it'll begin the new training on new data and using CI CD and using automation you can get a new model up on the production server without too much hassle so just imagine how much stress is gone from doing this manually to going to this automated ml Ops type of pipeline I hope this helps and I hope that you'll be able to see better accuracies and much more speed whenever you're training your models thank you thanks so much if you like this video and you want to see more like it please like And subscribe and my department said if we reach 10 000 likes they're going to pay for another month on the GPU server if you have any questions please drop them in the comments below"
