so let's talk about the three different buckets that exist with technology nowadays in the cloud native space or technology in general you have the traditional way of doing it now you have this new wave or Cloud native coming down the line and then also you have the serverless platform that is pretty new and still has a level of risk that you need to think about so let's dig into each one of these a little bit deeper we have our traditional ways of doing things we used to have this little war file or ear file or something like that to deploy our code to our servers then we'd have something that would sometimes take months or if not weeks to deploy and it costs so many frustrations what can we were moving past this and now we're moving to our new wave Frankly Speaking I'm calling it New Wave because I don't want to say cloud native over and over again but what is it it's our next step it's what we're moving past our traditional way of doing things we have these great things called containers now which allows us to be able to package up our code in smaller bits and be able to push things out in a fast efficient way and share code where it works on my laptop no longer means it just works on your laptop it works anywhere anywhere a container can run and another great thing about the new wave or the cloud native space is that it only takes minutes to deploy now you're probably wondering why am I talking about all this and I should be talking about risk we need to have some level set of understanding of all these different Technologies before we dig into the risk profiles of each of these and hopefully it'll open up some spaces for this serverless is still built off of containers just like our new wave or cognative space but the beauty of it is is it's so small it's just the changes you need to worry about it leverages true microservices where functions do all the work but that brings in an interesting risk profile when you start talking about these Technologies so let's actually take this next step and talk about what happens when you start worrying about these different systems for your risks so how are the companies actually mitigate risk when it comes to moving the cloud native first thing they do is they start to learn to trust their engineers but with that trust takes a little bit of time they'll cover something called the 4i rule and make small iterative changes with that comes at least four eyes looking at every Small Change to be able to be merged into the main main branch but when that gets merged what happens next they Leverage The Bots to do the work for you no longer do you have someone releasing some code at three in the morning instead when you merge it into the main branch the Bots take over and release the code for you this means you no longer have a Council of Elders of senior engineers and Executives discussing every single change now you let the Bots do the work for you but with that comes complexity we're going to talk about how to take care of some of that complexity however something called get UPS which believe it or not is pretty dang cool so what is get UPS simply said it's leveraging a git repository as your source of Truth for the deployment of your applications it can be production it can be development could be even Dev so how does get Ops actually make your life easier when it comes from from the angle of risk first thing first you can actually audit what any change you've ever made can you actually answer when the last time you deployed your application and who made what change the majority of people out there they can't whoever's in get UPS you actually have an audible system through the git history with that too that means you can also verify what the change has been made because it's cryptographically signed using the git hash algorithm this is important especially in regulated environments taking it a step farther if something horrible goes wrong you actually take that git Repository and recreate whatever you're trying to do in another environment this gives you the ability to make sure that it comes out exactly how you want every single time you have to leverage different Technologies though to enforce these get UPS principles like Argo CD or flux CD but that means you need to start trusting the Bots to do the work for you this is going to be a big problem for a lot of companies because no longer you're going to have humans do these changes you're now having the machines do the changes so you're going to have to spend some time with the operations team your SRE team your devops team to really be able to embrace this new mentality but you will reduce your risk in the long term because you'll be able to enforce things leveraging the get-offs principles thank you if you like this video and want to see more like it please like And subscribe if you have any questions please drop them in the comments below
