[Music] blockchain is a disruptive technology which is helping businesses worldwide to streamline trade by simplifying the sharing of data between businesses and a trusted way efficiencies are introduced that make a real difference lock chain services are fundamental to this streamlining because they enable different businesses to collaborate easily in a neutral environment the blockchain provides a secure distributed database that records and communicates transactions between businesses in a way that is efficient verifiable and permanent two significant challenges are inherent in blockchain transactions data flow and interaction latency in each business blockchain transactions have counterparts in on-premises applications and it's the flow of information between the two which is key to a successful integration also because blockchain interactions are encrypted and consensus-based they take longer than typical transactions and because a cloud-based blockchain service is likely to be geographically distant from an on-premises system latency can be a concern these data flow and interaction latency challenges can be solved using an asynchronous message driven architecture the qualities of service and platform coverage provided by ibm's premier mq messaging software make it ideal for performing disintegration meet petra from the Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV Petra has heard about a new cloud-based blockchain application which tracks all vehicles through its lifecycle the DMV already has an existing application used to send reminders to owners sometimes these reminders are sent to the previous owner of the vehicle instead of the current owner this is a problem for tax payers who were frustrated by perceived inefficiency it is also a problem for the DMV who received late payments petrol wants to fix this but her challenge is getting the cloud and on-premises MQ applications to work together she updates the tax application to send a query to the blockchain by using the MQ blockchain bridge she can simply place a request message on the bridge request queue finally Petra modifies the existing reminder notification processing so that it is driven by response messages from the bridge indicating confirmation or change of ownership by using the MQ blockchain bridge Petra has been able to combine the benefits of these two technologies to create a solution to benefits the business and their customers learn more about using blockchain and mq for z/os together at IBM vis / mq blockchain bridge [Music]
